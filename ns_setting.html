A magical utopia that exists in the spirit world and in material realms constructed to be perfect places to live without material want of any kind.
Imagine that the people born to this world look across the infinite planes and planets and see pain, suffering, and infinite need.
What would they do?
What would you do, if you had that kind of power?
What moral constraints would you place upon your own use of that power?
How would you help when your own ethics of equality forbid you from placing yourself over others, but the infinite power of your society makes you godlike compared to the people you might want to help.</p>
<p>That is the endpoint of the Tower Builders setting, so called by future archeaologists that study the massive towers they once built for magical purposes.
They eventually create a universe where human but powerful beings and their spirit companions reach out to other worlds to nudge them in the direction of better societies.
Those efforts are not without challenges.
In the meantime, how could we get there?
The following rules and setting is not about that imagined endpoint, where legendary beings known mysterously as "Those Who Build Towers" meddle in the affairs of mortals.
This setting is about their first era, before they even began to build.
A group of ordinary people touched by and studying the vast power of magic begin to dream of a world better than their own.</p>
<p>The first era could be called <strong>Exploration and Consolidation</strong>.
When we join the characters that you will play, we find them trained or at least touched by a kind of magic can can be developed, invented, and improved.
They look around their world, and see a history of wizards serving kings, shahs, warlords, village tyrants, and councils of selfish men that ignore and oppress a populace as tools for their own power.
Inside their hearts forms a hope that if they could band together and build an ethical way of life, perhaps they could end misery.
They imagine a world in which magic takes care of everyone and creates a lasting peace without standing atop the backs of the unfortunate many.</p>
<p>Your characters will be magicians, witches, wizards, sorcerers, warriors, caretakers and so forth that have ventured out into their world to take the great risk of making it better.
Their magic isn&#8217;t all powerful, and has a recent history of causing disaster.
So they will have to reach out to others and find those that see a future world where people are taken care of, equal, and free.
You characters will be those that risk their lives for the hope of a future.</p>
<p>The Exploration Era follows a magical apocalypse in which great empires have fallen, and some of the magical community feels a great guilt at its role in the crisis.
This is an early medieval world, trying to find its way after emperors have fallen and local tyrants are trying to take control.
The apocalypse left vast power vacuums filled by petty warlords using the remnants of the previous magical age to support their dreams of new empires.
They will spill as much blood as they need to to grab control.
But there are new teachers and magical schools training a new generation in magic, peaceful people building caring societies, and attempts to discover how magic can be used for the health and happiness of all.
Who will you be in a world just at the beginnings of a Great Project. How will you start to build a peaceful new society, while protecting it from the violence and manipulation of those who would return it to the past?</p>
