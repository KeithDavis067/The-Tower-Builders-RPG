When a character is casting magic and has abilities and power sets as described in <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>, they can gather dice in the following way:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Description:</strong> Describe the intended <span class="setting term">result.</span><ul><li>The result and target must allow you to include at least one <span class="setting term">magic die</span>, whether it&#8217;s from your character sheet or an available asset.
<strong>If you cannot find a magic die that could create the intended result and act on the target, your magic cannot help you.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Casting Dice:</strong> Select a <a href="#Targeting">[Targeting]</a> method appropriate to the ability and circumstances and choose an Attribute and Ability as <span class="setting term">Casting Dice</span>.<ul><li>If circumstances restrict a character from using the <span class="cortex term">Traits</span> recommended in <a href="#Targeting">[Targeting]</a> they may be able to choose other casting dice, but they may also consider switching targeting methods. Any <span class="cortex term">limit</span> that applies should be honored.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Complications</span> and <span class="cortex term">stress</span> on these traits apply as usual.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magic Dice:</strong> The intended <span class="setting term">result</span> or the <span class="setting term">target</span> determine the <span class="cortex term">distinction</span>, <span class="setting term">magical ability</span>, <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> and <span class="setting term">element</span> dice that may be included.<ul><li><strong>Distinctions:</strong> Characters will usually have a Distinction that describes their magic. This is the most obvious Distinction to use, but mundane distinctions may be more appropriate especially when <em>Hinder</em>-ing their efforts.</li><li><strong>Magical Abilities:</strong> If a magical ability&#8217;s description could create the result you may include it.
Note that descriptions often prescribe an <span class="setting term">element</span> that must be present in the <span class="setting term">result</span> or <span class="setting term">target</span> when using that Ability.
See the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> <em>Modify Ability</em> for a way around this.</li><li><strong>Taxonomies:</strong> If the elements of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> apply to the target or result, include the taxonomy that most closely applies.
If the taxonomy&#8217;s elements apply weakly, make the roll harder (choose a consistent method such as stepping down the die or improving the <span class="cortex term">opposition</span>'s pool).</li><li><strong>Elements:</strong> If an element die of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> applies to the target or result, include it as well.</li></ul></li></ol></div></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-04-28 17:57:10 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
