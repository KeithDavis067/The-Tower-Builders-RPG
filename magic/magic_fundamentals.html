Nothing was obvioiusly amiss, but some internal sense froze him at the clearing&#8217;s edge.
His eyes darted around seeking some evidence for his caution.
There is was: the leaves in the center of the clearing kept drawing his gaze.
They seemed to be scattered naturally, but their positions had been influenced by something not immediately apparent, like iron shavings around a lodestone.
Reaching into one of the many pouches hanging within his coat, he blew a pinch of dust of carbonized birdbone as hard as he could into the clearing.
It caught the light, forming subtle streams that tracked his eyes straight to a set of rocks just peaking above the turf.
<strong>There</strong>. He must discover why those rocks had made this clearing magical. And if they signalled danger.</p>
<p><strong>The Tower Builders</strong> exist in fundamentally magical world.
The following is an attempt to describe the nature of magic in that world, so that players and GMs can build an agreed upon common sense that will apply to the uncommon nature of magic.
For any flexible magic system, moments will come up when players and GMs need to adjudicate questions about magic and the world.
The following should be thought of as the core magical reality for the Tower Builders setting.
This is not necessarily how the <em>characters</em> see magic or reality, but it&#8217;s a message of intention from the setting designers.
As with any RPG your mileage may vary, play the game you want, and there are no RPG police that will come to your house
and slap your wrist to correct your play.
But, if you want a starting point to refer to about what magic is and how it works, this will hopefully help.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_on_science">On Science</h2><p>To understand what magic is, it&#8217;s helpful to understand what magic <em>isn&#8217;t</em>.
Consider aspirin.
It can reliably reduce fevers and pain, and is naturally made in certain plants.
In a world where magic is an available explanation for the power of a plant to cure, is the plant magical, or is there a material the plant makes that interacts with the material structure of the body to relieve fever and pain?
In a magical world, is there a difference?
Is a sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic or is it actually magic?
Is magic just a technology that&#8217;s not fully understood, and so it seems mysterious?
In standard versions of the setting, the world of the Tower Builders is a fundamentally materialistic world, but there&#8217;s an extra component of magic and meaning that affects the material in a real way. For starters, let&#8217;s get a few points on the table:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>The basic physical laws of our real universe apply.
Objects are made out of particles, and mathematics as we know it can describe physics.
Whether that physics is <em>known</em> on in a particular world within the setting is a different question.</li><li>Ecology and evolution by natural selection drive biology.</li><li>Science as a method of discovery functions, but the ability to do controlled experiments is challenged by the existence of magic.</li></ul></div>
<p>The Tower Builders setting explicitly separates magic and science, in part so that we can still have fun with technology in certain versions of the setting.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_magic">Magic</h2><p>Ok so what is magic?</p>
<p class="definition"><strong>Magic is the manipulation of a component of reality that exists with the material.</strong>
This extra layer could be called the astral or the spiritual, but those words are layered with extra meaning that doesn&#8217;t always apply.
For now we&#8217;ll call it <span class="setting term">occult nature</span>.
<span class="setting term">occult nature</span> holds qualities, characteristics, or essences that influence material things and are influenced by material things in return. Consider an acorn in a forest.
Its occult nature would include elements of everything that make it an acorn. That includes its shape, components and molecules, the brownness of its cap, its potential to be a tree, and so on to every little minute detail.
It also includes its past and future. Part of it is the tree that grew it, the process by which it grew, how far it fell and the tree it will become.
Fundamentally, the entire acorn and all of its acornness is contained within its occult nature.
But it would not, in this case, be magical in any way. Its occult nature is completely aligned with being an acorn.
If you take it out of the forest, and bring it into a city, it is now an acorn that has been brought from that forest, and its occult nature will reflect that.
But it&#8217;s still not magical. But give that acorn to a skilled magus, and they can use, manipulate and work with every element of that acorn.
That magus could:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Use the acorn to find the forest it was brought from.</li><li>Tell you whether the acorn will ever be planted.</li><li>Make the acorn become its eventual tree instantly.
But the acorn is useful for other things as well, because the acorn grows from something very small into something monumental, that acorn can be used to encourage growth in children, focus the mind for a project of growth.</li></ul></div>
<p>The magical properties don&#8217;t happen without a skilled magus or wizard activating them.</p>
<p>Some important truths about occult nature:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>It is not a material or energy and cannot be counted or measured. It&#8217;s <em>effects</em> can be measured, and it can have stronger or weaker affects on the world, but these are consequences of a strength or intensity of qualities of the layer, not consequences of an amount of the layer. E.g. A clearing in a forest with a great intensity of fire essence may burst into flame repeatedly and without explanation, but a lesser intensity might make make the clearing warmer than the surrounding forest.</li><li>It is not secondary to the physical world. It is as much a part of reality as the material and completely infuses it as a co-equal component of the real.</li><li>The interplay between the occult nature and the material goes both ways.</li><li>Magic is the art of controlling the occult nature for effects.
The supernature of a thing.
The law of attention which parts you</li></ol></div>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</h3><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>The Law of Nature.</strong> A thing is what it is. This is why material components in magic are so useful.
By bringing in an herb, mineral, or other object into a spell you bring its occult nature or qualities into the spell.
It is also through this law that constructed things, including immaterial things like language, can become magical.
They can be made to be a magical thing.</li><li><strong>The Law of Path.</strong> The past, present, and future of an object are included in its occult nature.
A well known corollary, often called a law in its own right is:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>The Law of Contagion (or Contact) - Often stated as "once together, always together," it means that objects retain a connection after they are separated.</li></ol></li><li><strong>The Law of Perception.</strong> How an object is seen affects its occult nature.
This is the tricky one, fundamental to so much of the slipperyness of magic.
Perception is so flexible across culture, time and even a person&#8217;s mood in the moment that it is very hard for magic to remain truly stable across contexts.
Stated succinctly, wizards must always remember that:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li><strong>Context Matters.</strong></li></ol></li></ol></div>
<p>The first law, is why studying the real world is so important for magicians.
Natural science tells you more clearly what an object is, so you can better understand its natural occult nature.
Knowing the details of an acorn and the species of tree it can become lets you better predict what effect an acorn can have on a spell, or what you need to do to an acorn to bring it into magic.
The Law of Path explains why magic can see through time, via divination or other effects, and why certain preparations can make magical ingredients more potent.
Acorns that have been dried in the sun and ground up have had solar and crushing occult nature mixed in with the acorns natural occult nature.</p>
<p>The third law is the really tricky one.
It explains how magical language, systems, and ritual can become so powerful.
It is why different cultures see so many magical things differently.
Our behaviour and actions around things affect their occult nature, and the magic that can be done with them.
Items can become holy when treated as such.
Consider a town with a "Judgement Oak" at northermost edge of town it treats as sacred for centuries.
For generations every major collective decision is made there, treaties are signed with ink made from its sap, votes are taken by holding up its leaves, and leaders are crowned with wreaths of its branches.
No one is allowed to build north of the tree until you reach the river a half a mile away.
That tree cannot help but be sacred.
In a world of magic could you cut it down?
Would it let you?
Would the town survive if you succeeded?
The town, through a collective act has made that tree more than a tree.
Furthermore, things which are perceived as similar can be treated as the same.
Leading to another corollary called:
 .. The Law of Similarity. - Things which seem to be the same are in fact the same in many ways.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with the game?
This fundamental theory of magic creates a set of <em>requirements</em> for magic.
Players and <strong>GM</strong>'s are encouraged to have characters take actions explained by these laws, and even given reason to limit their character&#8217;s magical powers based on these laws.
The nature of the magic creates reasons for the actions characters must take to make magic happen, explanations for why cultures use magic so differently, and dramatic moments when the these laws will determine what the characters must, or cannot, accomplish.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_doing_magic_and_casting_spells">Doing Magic and Casting Spells</h3><p>So how does a <em>character</em> do magic?
The rest of this chapter will expand upon it, but the the core quite simple:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Select a <span class="setting term">target</span> and <span class="setting term">result</span> for the spell.</li><li>Create the conditions needed to bring the occult nature of the <span class="setting term">target</span> into alignment with the result of the spell.</li></ol></div>
<p>This story-driven need to do specific things will guide players and Game Moderators to know the actions that the characters <em>must</em> take, or abilities they must have to accomplish certain feats of magic.
The fiction drives the rules, and the rules should reflect the fiction.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_sources_of_occult_nature">Sources of occult nature</h2><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_basics_of_material_magic_and_material_components">The Basics of Material Magic and Material Components</h3><p>As an example of how materials can influence magic, let&#8217;s return to an acorn.
An acorn could one day be a tree.
Because of the Law of the Path, the acorn&#8217;s occult nature includes that future tree.
So a Magician that wants to drop that acorn on the ground and have it grow instantly into a tree bring must the <em>future</em> occult nature of the acorn into its <em>current</em> nature.
That&#8217;s an example of manipulating the acorn&#8217;s occult nature.
A character might do that in one of many ways, such as by a using <span class="setting term">magical power</span> built from the <span class="cortex term">Time Control</span> <span class="cortex term">ability</span> or a power built around controlling nature or trees.</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to make an acorn into a magic acorn that turns a living target to stone.
Nowhere in the occult nature of an acorn is anything that is particularly stonelike.
But acorns can last a long time before they are planted and grow into a tree. Can we treat acorns as having an occult nature that includes hibernation or suspended life?
Certainly!
Broad definitions like this often create disagreement about when an object has a certain occult nature, and when it does not.
As a way to manage these challenges, if the <strong>GM</strong> or group decides that a use of an item&#8217;s occult nature is valid, but on the edge of what&#8217;s valid, you should increase the difficulty of any <span class="setting term">result</span> that uses a weak occult nature of that item.
This is necessarily a judgement call and each group will find its favorite ways of making that call.
Some groups will let the <strong>GM</strong> make the call alone, but others may put it up to a vote by the table.
However you would like to do it is up to your group.</p>
<p>So, back to magic acorns that turn people into stone.
An acorn might be able to force someone into hibernation, but that&#8217;s a far cry from stone.
80&#8217;s fantasy movies aside, what then is a good option for creating a stone inducing throwable weapon?
Pebbles are an obvious one, but even better would be a stone that was once a living thing or at least strongly related to a living thing.
Consider:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Petrified wood.</li><li>Kidney or bladder stones, or any of the various stones that come from a living thing.</li><li>Bones.</li><li>Seashells.</li></ul></div>
<p>All of the above are items that were once living, but are now stonelike.
They are each well suited for magic that turns living things to stone.
But we wanted magic not to turn someone into stone, but to create an item that, when thrown at a living target, turns it to stone.
Let&#8217;s put a pause on that and come back to it in <a href="magic items.html">magic items</a>.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_basics_of_taxonomies_and_elements">The Basics of Taxonomies and Elements</h3><p>In the above, we considered doing magic by including an object as a source of the occult nature required for the spell.
That is called material magic or using material components in magic.
If you read the fiction sprinkled through the book, you will notice plenty of examples of magicians that do not seem to use material magic at all.
These mages are always waving their hands and speaking in mysterious languages opaque to the outsider.
The may draw symbols in the air, or call to gods they have relationships with.
They are doing the same thing as above, but instead of getting the occult nature they need from an item, they are creating it from their mind.
Characters that use magic like this are using a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span>.
With enough study and practice, the magician can rely directly on the symbols they have carved into their own minds to be powerful enough to <em>create</em> the occult nature they need.
This is Symbolic Magic, or using symbolic components in magic.
A collection or structured group of symbols is called, generally, a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span>.
Magicians of most cultures have discovered this kind of magic, so different traditions will use these techniques in a wide array of ways.
Taxonomies will look different from culture to culture, and some cultures may have a single taxonomy that they equate with fundamental truth.</p>
<p>As an example, wizards from farming cultures will have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> constructed of symbols for working animals, vital crops, seasons and family structures.
Those from peoples with strong philosophical traditions will have abstract ideas within their <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span>, such as chaos, the atom, sets of virtues, and so on.
Different magic school will teach different <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span> and most will favor one or two over others, so the taxonomies a particular character uses will relate to their identity and history.</p>
<p>Consider our above example of turning someone to stone. Think through the legends and stories you know, are there any that feature as a core theme restriction of movement, action, or even literally turning someone into stone? I&#8217;ll imagine there are.
The Greek legend of Pygmalion is about an artist that so fell in love with his creation that it came to life.
A wizard might have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> called <span class="setting name">Greek Myth</span>, within which a symbol called <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> is available for use.
So can a wizard use Pygmalion to create acorns that turn enemies to stone?
Certainly!
They simply need to infuse the acorn&#8217;s occult nature with the occult nature from their deep study of greek myth and the Pygmalion story.
But it&#8217;s important to remember that when the <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> element is summoned you get all of it at once. The caster must manage the parts of the element they do not want.
Complications that appear when hitches occur might involve awkward emotional relationships with the target of the magic!</p>
