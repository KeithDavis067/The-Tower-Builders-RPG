Nothing was obvioiusly amiss, but some internal sense froze him at the clearing&#8217;s edge.
His eyes darted around seeking some evidence for his caution.
There is was: the leaves in the center of the clearing kept drawing his gaze.
They seemed to be scattered naturally, but their positions had been influenced by something not immediately apparent, like iron shavings around a lodestone.
Reaching into one of the many pouches hanging within his coat, he blew a pinch of dust of carbonized birdbone as hard as he could into the clearing.
It caught the light, forming subtle streams that tracked his eyes straight to a set of rocks just peaking above the turf.
<strong>There</strong>. He must discover why those rocks had made this clearing magical. And if they signalled danger.</p>
<p><strong>The Tower Builders</strong> exist in fundamentally magical world.
The following is an attempt to describe the nature of magic in that world, so that players and GMs can build an agreed upon common sense that will apply to the uncommon nature of magic.
For any flexible magic system, moments will come up when players and GMs need to adjudicate questions about magic and the world.
The following should be thought of as the core magical reality for the Tower Builders setting.
This is not necessarily how the <em>characters</em> see magic or reality, but it&#8217;s a message of intention from the setting designers.
As with any RPG your mileage may vary, play the game you want, and there are no RPG police that will come to your house
and slap your wrist to correct your play.
But, if you want a starting point to refer to about what magic is and how it works, this will hopefully help.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_on_science">On Science</h2><p>To understand what magic is, it&#8217;s helpful to understand what magic <em>isn&#8217;t</em>.
Consider aspirin.
It can reliably reduce fevers and pain, and is naturally made in certain plants.
In a world where magic is an available explanation for the power of a plant to cure, is the plant magical, or is there a material the plant makes that interacts with the material structure of the body to relieve fever and pain?
In a magical world, is there a difference?
Is a sufficiently advanced technology indistinguishable from magic or is it actually magic?
Is magic just a technology that&#8217;s not fully understood, and so it seems mysterious?
In standard versions of the setting, the world of the Tower Builders is a fundamentally materialistic world, but there&#8217;s an extra component of magic and meaning that affects the material in a real way. For starters, let&#8217;s get a few points on the table:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>The basic physical laws of our real universe apply.
Objects are made out of particles, and mathematics as we know it can describe physics.
Whether that physics is <em>known</em> on in a particular world within the setting is a different question.</li><li>Ecology and evolution by natural selection drive biology.</li><li>Science as a method of discovery functions, but the ability to do controlled experiments is challenged by the existence of magic.</li></ul></div>
<p>The Tower Builders setting explicitly separates magic and science, in part so that we can still have fun with technology in certain versions of the setting.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_magic">Magic</h2><p>Ok so what is magic?</p>
<p class="definition"><strong>Magic is the manipulation of a component of reality that exists with the material.</strong>
This extra layer could be called the astral or the spiritual, but those words are layered with extra meaning that doesn&#8217;t always apply.
For now we&#8217;ll call it <span class="setting term">occult nature</span>.
<span class="setting term">occult nature</span> holds qualities, characteristics, or essences that influence material things and are influenced by material things in return. Consider an acorn in a forest.
Its occult nature would include elements of everything that make it an acorn. That includes its shape, components and molecules, the brownness of its cap, its potential to be a tree, and so on to every little minute detail.
It also includes its past and future. Part of it is the tree that grew it, the process by which it grew, how far it fell and the tree it will become.
Fundamentally, the entire acorn and all of its acornness is contained within its occult nature.
But it would not, in this case, be magical in any way. Its occult nature is completely aligned with being an acorn.
If you take it out of the forest, and bring it into a city, it is now an acorn that has been brought from that forest, and its occult nature will reflect that.
But it&#8217;s still not magical. But give that acorn to a skilled magus, and they can use, manipulate and work with every element of that acorn.
That magus could:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Use the acorn to find the forest it was brought from.</li><li>Tell you whether the acorn will ever be planted.</li><li>Make the acorn become its eventual tree instantly.
But the acorn is useful for other things as well, because the acorn grows from something very small into something monumental, that acorn can be used to encourage growth in children, focus the mind for a project of growth.</li></ul></div>
<p>The magical properties don&#8217;t happen without a skilled magus or wizard activating them.</p>
<p>Some important truths about occult nature:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>It is not a material or energy and cannot be counted or measured. It&#8217;s <em>effects</em> can be measured, and it can have stronger or weaker affects on the world, but these are consequences of a strength or intensity of qualities of the layer, not consequences of an amount of the layer. E.g. A clearing in a forest with a great intensity of fire essence may burst into flame repeatedly and without explanation, but a lesser intensity might make make the clearing warmer than the surrounding forest.</li><li>It is not secondary to the physical world. It is as much a part of reality as the material and completely infuses it as a co-equal component of the real.</li><li>The interplay between the occult nature and the material goes both ways.</li><li>Magic is the art of controlling the occult nature for effects.
The supernature of a thing.
The law of attention which parts you</li></ol></div>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</h3><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>The Law of Nature.</strong> A thing is what it is. This is why material components in magic are so useful.
By bringing in an herb, mineral, or other object into a spell you bring its occult nature or qualities into the spell.
It is also through this law that constructed things, including immaterial things like language, can become magical.
They can be made to be a magical thing.</li><li><strong>The Law of Path.</strong> The past, present, and future of an object are included in its occult nature.
A well known corollary, often referred to a law in its own right is:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>The Law of Contagion (or Contact) - Often stated as "once together, always together," it means that objects retain a connection after they are separated.</li></ol></li><li><strong>The Law of Perception.</strong> How an object is seen affects its occult nature.
This is the tricky one, fundamental to so much of the slipperyness of magic.
Perception is so flexible across culture, time and even a person&#8217;s mood in the moment that it is very hard for magic to remain truly stable across contexts.
Stated succinctly, wizards must always remember that:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li><strong>Context Matters.</strong></li></ol></li></ol></div>
<p>This is an enormous part of magic, it is the core reason philosophy, language, and study are so important to magic.
It is why different cultures see so many magical things differently.
Consider a town with a "Judgement Oak" at northermost edge of town it treats as sacred for centuries.
For generations every major collective decision is made there, treaties are signed with ink made from its sap, votes are taken by holding up its leaves, and leaders are crowned with wreaths of its branches.
No one is allowed to build north of the tree until you reach the river a half a mile away.
That tree cannot help but be sacred.
In a world of magic could you cut it down?
Would it let you?
Would the town survive if you succeeded?
The town, through a collective act has made that tree more than a tree.
Furthermore, things which are perceived as similar can be treated as the same.
Leading to another corollary called:
 .. The Law of Similarity. - Things which seem to be the same are in fact the same in many ways.</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with the game?
This fundamental theory of magic creates a set of <em>requirements</em> for magic.
Players and <strong>GM</strong>'s are encouraged to have characters take actions explained by these laws, and even given reason to limit their character&#8217;s magical powers based on these laws.
The nature of the magic creates reasons for the actions characters must take to make magic happen, explanations for why cultures use magic so differently, and dramatic moments when the these laws will determine what the characters must, or cannot, accomplish.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_doing_magic_and_casting_spells">Doing Magic and Casting Spells</h3><p>So how does a character do magic?
The rest of this chapter will expand upon it, but the the core quite simple:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Select a <span class="setting term">target</span> and <span class="setting term">result</span> for the spell.</li><li>Create the conditions needed to bring the occult nature of the <span class="setting term">target</span> into alignment with the result of the spell.</li></ol></div>
<p>All of the rules recommendations are common ways to accomplish these two steps.</p>
