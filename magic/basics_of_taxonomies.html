That is called material magic or using material components in magic.
If you read the fiction sprinkled through the book, you will notice plenty of examples of magicians that do not seem to use material magic at all.
These mages are always waving their hands and speaking in mysterious languages opaque to the outsider.
The may draw symbols in the air, or call to gods they have relationships with.
They are doing the same thing as above, but instead of getting the occult nature they need from an item, they are creating it from their mind.
Characters that use magic like this are using a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span>.
With enough study and practice, the magician can rely directly on the symbols they have carved into their own minds to be powerful enough to <em>create</em> the occult nature they need.
This is Symbolic Magic, or using symbolic components in magic.
A collection or structured group of symbols is called, generally, a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span>.
Magicians of most cultures have discovered this kind of magic, so different traditions will use these techniques in a wide array of ways.
Taxonomies will look different from culture to culture, and some cultures may have a single taxonomy that they equate with fundamental truth.</p>
<p>As an example, wizards from farming cultures will have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> constructed of symbols for working animals, vital crops, seasons and family structures.
Those from peoples with strong philosophical traditions will have abstract ideas within their <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span>, such as chaos, the atom, sets of virtues, and so on.
Different magic school will teach different <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span> and most will favor one or two over others, so the taxonomies a particular character uses will relate to their identity and history.</p>
<p>Consider our above example of turning someone to stone. Think through the legends and stories you know, are there any that feature as a core theme restriction of movement, action, or even literally turning someone into stone? I&#8217;ll imagine there are.
The Greek legend of Pygmalion is about an artist that so fell in love with his creation that it came to life.
A wizard might have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> called <span class="setting name">Greek Myth</span>, within which a symbol called <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> is available for use.
So can a wizard use Pygmalion to create acorns that turn enemies to stone?
Certainly!
They simply need to infuse the acorn&#8217;s occult nature with the occult nature from their deep study of greek myth and the Pygmalion story.
But it&#8217;s important to remember that when the <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> element is summoned you get all of it at once. The caster must manage the parts of the element they do not want.
Complications that appear when hitches occur might involve awkward emotional relationships with the target of the magic!</p></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-06-06 18:52:34 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
