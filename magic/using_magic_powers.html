Fortunately, manipulating the invisible forces that pervade reality is rarely straightforward.
You read that correctly: if it were straightforward it wouldn&#8217;t be any fun.
As you read the following, keep in mind there are definitely ways to play in the Tower Builders setting that keep your creativity centered on character, story, and problem solving.
If you&#8217;re interested in that sort of play we&#8217;d suggest using <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span> with the usual <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> rules, or see <a href="{sourcedir}/Setting.asciidoc/Ways of Using.html">ways of using</a> the setting.
Still, magic in the Tower Builders setting should have in-character meaning.
There should be a <em>theory</em> of magic that makes magic in the setting more than just wishing for anything that could happen.</p>
<p>The following rules are an attempt to expose some of the artistry of magic to the player.
When you use magic in the game, you should feel a connection between what the rules require and what the character must <em>do</em>, so that everyone at the table knows why your character is waving their hands around like that.
The following describes how to <em>use</em> magic powers, for creating those powers see <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_introduction">Introduction</h2><p>When players are building characters, they will want to know what their character is capable of, and how to build a character with the abilities they envision.
So in a game without clearly defined spells, what can a character <em>do</em> with magic?
The answer comes from the theory of magic as manipulating the hidden occult nature of things as described in <a href="Fundamentals of Magic.html">fundamentals of magic</a>.
Story-wise, magic is always doing one of two things:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Taking the occult nature that already exists in the target and shifting it around, <strong>OR</strong></li><li>Adding occult nature to the target from somewhere or something else, <strong>OR</strong></li><li>Some combination of both.</li></ol></div></section>

<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_basics">Basics</h2><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_basics_of_material_magic_and_material_components">The Basics of Material Magic and Material Components</h3><p>As an example, let&#8217;s return to an acorn.
An acorn could one day be a tree.
Because of the Law of the Path, the acorn&#8217;s occult nature includes that future possible tree.
So a Magician that wants to drop that acorn on the ground and have it grow instantly into a tree bring must the <em>future</em> occult nature of the acorn into its <em>current</em> nature.
That&#8217;s an example of manipulating the acorn&#8217;s occult nature.
A character might do that in one of many ways, such as by a using <span class="setting term">magical power</span> built from the <span class="cortex term">Time Control</span> <span class="cortex term">ability</span> or a power built around controlling nature or trees.</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to make an acorn into a magic acorn, that makes a living target freeze in place, as if turned to stone.
Nowhere in the occult nature of an acorn is the ability to turn objects into stone.
But acorns can last a long time before they are planted and grow into a tree. Can we treat acorns as having an occult nature that includes hibernation or suspended life?
Certainly!
Broad definitions like this can create disagreement about when an object has a certain occult nature, and when it does not.
As a way to manage these challenges, if the <strong>GM</strong> or group decides that a use of an item&#8217;s occult nature is valid, but on the edge of what&#8217;s valid, you should increase the difficulty of any <span class="setting term">result</span> that uses a weak occult nature of that item.
This is necessarily a judgement call and each group will find its favorite ways of making that call.
Some groups will let the <strong>GM</strong> make the call alone, but others may put it up to a vote by the table.
However you would like to do it is up to your group.</p>
<p>So, back to magic acorns that turn people into stone.
So an acorn might be able to force someone into hibernation, but that&#8217;s a far cry from stone.
80&#8217;s fantasy movies aside, what then is a good option for creating a stone inducing throwable weapon? Pebbles are an obvious one, but even better would be a stone that was once a living thing or at least strongly related to a living thing.
Consider:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Petrified wood.</li><li>Kidney or bladder stones, or any of the various stones that come from a living thing.</li><li>Bones.</li><li>Seashells.</li></ul></div>
<p>All of the above are items that were once living, but are now stonelike.
They are each very well suited for magic that turns living things to stone.
But we wanted magic not to turn someone into stone, but to create an item that, when thrown at a living target, turns it to stone.
Let&#8217;s put a pause on that and come back to it in <a href="magic items.html">magic items</a>.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_basics_of_taxonomies_and_elements">The Basics of Taxonomies and Elements</h3><p>In the above, we considered doing magic by including an object as a source of the occult nature required for the spell.
That is called material magic or using material components in magic.
If you read the fiction sprinkled through the book, you will notice plenty of examples of magicians that do not seem to use material magic at all.
These mages are always waving their hands and speaking in mysterious languages opaque to the outsider.
The may draw symbols in the air, or call to gods they have relationships with.
They are doing the same thing as above, but instead of getting the occult nature they need from an item, they are creating it from their mind.
Characters that use magic like this are using a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span>.
With enough study and practice, the magician can rely directly on the symbols they have carved into their own minds to be powerful enough to <em>create</em> the occult nature they need.
This is Symbolic Magic, or using symbolic components in magic.
A collection or structured group of symbols is called, generally, a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span>.
Magicians of most cultures have discovered this kind of magic, so different traditions will use these techniques in a wide array of ways.
Taxonomies will look different from culture to culture, and some cultures may have a single taxonomy that they equate with fundamental truth.</p>
<p>As an example, wizards from farming cultures will have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> constructed of symbols for working animals, vital crops, seasons and family structures.
Those from peoples with strong philosophical traditions will have abstract ideas within their <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span>, such as chaos, the atom, sets of virtues, and so on.
Different magic school will teach different <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span> and most will favor one or two over others, so the taxonomies a particular character uses will relate to their identity and history.</p>
<p>Consider our above example of turning someone to stone. Think through the legends and stories you know, are there any that feature as a core theme restriction of movement, action, or even literally turning someone into stone? I&#8217;ll imagine there are.
The Greek legend of Pygmalion is about an artist that so fell in love with his creation that it came to life.
A wizard might have a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> called <span class="setting name">Greek Myth</span>, within which a symbol called <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> is available for use.
So can a wizard use Pygmalion to create acorns that turn enemies to stone?
Certainly!
They simply need to infuse the acorn&#8217;s occult nature with the occult nature from their deep study of greek myth and the Pygmalion story.
But it&#8217;s important to remember that when the <span class="setting name">Pygmalion</span> element is summoned you get all of it at once. The caster must manage the parts of the element they do not want.
Complications that appear when hitches occur might involve awkward emotional relationships with the target of the magic!</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_casting">Casting</h2><p>Magic always changes or manipulates the occult nature of an object in a way that makes it different than another non-magical object of its type.
This can happen for many reasons, and we encourage GMs and Players to play around with including naturally magical things in their games.
But for the most part, the PC&#8217;s in Tower Builders will be spellworkers, wizards, witches, mages, warlocks and so on.
And spellworkers <strong>cast</strong>.
The following are some rules and suggestions for how the metaphysics of magic in Tower Builders should determine when <span class="setting term">Magical abilities</span> and <span class="setting term">Improvisational Powers</span> apply to your roll, and how to think about the actions around casting magic.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_casting_and_casting_dice">Casting and Casting Dice</h3><p><span class="system term">Casting</span> refers to the <em>activities</em> that a character undertakes to create a magical <span class="system term">Result</span>.
Said another way, casting is what you <em>do</em> to make magic happen.
In many cases, this will match what we see from popular fiction about magic: shouting in magic languages, gesturing with hands and magic wands, boiling up disgusting brews and so on.
Most of these are normal tasks a character could undertake without magic so they are represented by the prime sets <span class="cortex term">Attributes</span> and <span class="setting term">Training</span>.
It is the wizard&#8217;s intent (and years of magical study) that make these skills useful for magic.
Choose casting dice that represent the attribute and training that apply best to the character&#8217;s actions, even if they are not the character&#8217;s best dice.
Afterall, failure in magic is certainly exciting.</p>
<p>As always, the group can make choices about how much detail and effort they want to put into a test.
Most <span class="setting term">results</span> should be handled by a single test, but narratively crucial, long-term, or quest based tests might be broken up into peices.
In this case, think about what the character is <em>doing</em> at each stage of the spell and how the result of that test helps the eventual spell or ritual.
You could even use completely mundane efforts to create temporary assets that help casting later.
For instance, planning a large ritual and getting a whole church to participate could provide Resources to help with the casting, or spending a lot of time building a complex mandala might provide a temporary asset to make the casting test easier.
GMs might want to place some limits on how much time the character can spend preparing, but the risk of rolling Hitches on earlier tests will probably suffice to keep preparation from creating too much of an advantage.
Remember, though that most of the time a single dice pool should represent the entire effort of the character when making magic.
In that case, the dice you choose might be the best dice for several skills used over the course of the casting, rather than a single event.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_attributes_and_casting">Attributes and Casting</h4><p>For a player trying to choose their casting dice, it can be helpful to consider what the Attributes bring to the table in magic.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Head</strong>
Head is the character&#8217;s reason, logic, and understanding of the world.
Choose Head as a casting die when casting benefits from work that depends upon the rules of logic like mathematics, philosophy, science, or engineering.
Theology as a thought discipline, as opposed to faith, can also rely upon Head when the exact meaning of ancient documents and beliefs are important.
Some examples of casting activities for which Head is a good choice:<ul><li>Styles that choose the time and place of casting via the motions of the stars require calculations and understanding of those motions.
If the test has multiple steps the calculation might create an asset that helps the magic,</li><li>Creating a magical item that behaves like a device such as a vehicle or clockwork.</li><li>Healing by understanding the body&#8217;s needs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Heart</strong>
Heart is the character&#8217;s courage or strength of character and wilingness to put forth effort.
Choose Heart as a casting die when the characters willingness to sacrifice themselves or their compassion for others determines how well the magic goes.
Some examples:<ul><li>Endurance or pain tests.</li><li>Defending yourself with magic when your ideals are tested.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Eyes</strong>
Eyes is the character&#8217;s literal senses and their ability to <strong>hear</strong> the words and needs of others.
Choose Eyes in magical tests when awareness of the world or the needs of others can help.
**</li></ul></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_casting_and_subtlety">Casting and Subtlety</h4><p>Waving your hands dramatically and shouting at the top of your lungs, pulling out powders and blowing them in the air are not subtle actions.
It can be pretty easy for the average citizen to note that you are casting, even if they have no idea how magic works.
But some magical results depend upon subtlety to function.
It is much easier to resist manipulation when your know you are being manipulated, and sneaking into a dark storehouse is much easier when you aren&#8217;t shouting magic words at the top of your lungs.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_casting_dice">Casting Dice</h4><p>The <span class="cortex term">Attribute</span> and <span class="cortex term">Training</span> you include in the dice pool are</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_casting_and_limits">Casting and Limits</h4><p>Magical abilities will usually be part of a Power Set with at least one Limit.
If the GM approves abilities outside of power sets, they should still have a limit.
The Cortex Prime system</p>
<p>Any Power set that requires casting, should be unavailable when the character (not necessarily the player) can&#8217;t find a way to meet their own power&#8217;s casting needs.
Rather that write a long description of what&#8217;s required, characters should consider the description of their Magic Power distinction to be the core of this.
This is where they decribe how their magic works in the broadest sense.
To complicate matters, you may sometimes feel like casting should be a different action than using the result.
Consider using magic to make yourself invisible to sneak past a guard.
You could:
* Choose a pool of</p>
<p>But there are a few universally applicable guidelines that everyone should use when considering what activities to choose for casting.</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Effort Matters</strong>.
The bigger and more grand the <span class="setting term">result</span>, the bigger and more grand the casting methods should be.
This is reflected in SFX that allow the character to take on extra effort (more time, fancier materials) to step up or double dice.
There are also SFX that step down dice when everything does not quite align.
But it&#8217;s also a general truth of magic, and can guide the GM in determining the base difficulty for casting.
See <a href="#Magical Style SFX">[Magical Style SFX]</a></li><li><strong>Symbolism</strong> matters.
The better the activity aligns with the intended <span class="setting term">result</span> the easier the spell.</li></ol></div>
<p>Along with the Requires Casting Limit, every magic power requires <span class="setting term">targeting</span>.
Targeting is explained in another section, but the method a character uses usually sets some requirements for the roll.
In system terms, it determines what dice you are using for casting and therefore what complications apply to the roll.
These <span class="setting term">"casting dice"</span> are usually one <span class="cortex term">attribute</span> and one <span class="setting term">training</span> trait.</p>
<p>When casting a spell, if the player is using a <span class="setting term">Magical Power</span> for a <span class="setting term">result</span> that matches its description, the power works as inended without explanation.
If the character is using a <span class="setting term">taxonomy power</span> the player should describe to the table what elements of the occult nature of the target you are changing, and have a source of any necessary occult nature that is not already present.
The player should also describe what the character is doing to create the magical result.
This does not always need to be detailed or unique, many powers will always work the same way, but it can be a lot of fun when improvising.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_example_casting">Example Casting</h4><div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Jerry&#8217;s character Isabel wants to give her loyal malamute, Rex, wings and increase his size so that she can use him to fly over Aurilia&#8217;s castle walls.
Being a docg, Rex has no connection to any creature that can fly and so no occult nature helpful for the <span class="setting term">Result</span>. This is how the conversation at the table might go:</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: So, I want to give Rex wings and make him big enough to ride.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, how are you going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Well, Isabel has her <span class="power trait">Bag of Many Components</span> which could have an feather of a large flying creature, and she has studied the <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> <span class="setting power">Nobility of Pastoral Life</span>, which should definitely have a <span class="setting term">Reference</span> for beasts of burden in it.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, great. This will be a test, and the base difficulty is two d8&#8217;s. So you have an <span class="setting term">elements</span> that could help your with flight or a riding animal?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> No, the only specialties I have are 'Oxen' and 'Self Sufficiency'. Does oxen count?</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Oxen would help him carry heavy weight, but being Oxen being large heavy animals, I think you&#8217;d cause yourself more trouble than that element is worth since you want to fly.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Right, I won&#8217;t include it then.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, I&#8217;m going to up the difficulty to d10&#8217;s because I think a feather from a large enough bird might be pretty hard to keep from getting crushed in that bag. You get your casting dice, your 'Bag of Many Components' die, whatever distinctions apply, and your Pastoral Life die. How is Isabella casting this?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> The usual improvisational rhyming, and I&#8217;ll stick the feathers to his shoulder blades with some tree resin.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, so your casting dice are <strong class="trait">Voice</strong> and <span class="trait">Perform</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> All right, so I have: The <span class="power trait">Villiage Witch</span> distinction die, <strong>Hands</strong> and <strong>Perform</strong> for casting, <span class="trait">Bag of Many Components</span> signature asset, and <span class="power trait">Nobility of Pastoral Life</span>.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Rolling difficulty dice . . .</p></div></div>
<p>As you can see above, the player needed to determine what Abilities and Taxonomy(s) they were using, <em>and</em> what the character was doing in the fiction to cast the spell.
These actions determined what dice were available for the roll.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_building_a_dice_pool">Building a Dice Pool</h3><p>Like anything in Cortex, the character&#8217;s goal determines the dice they can recruit for their dice pool.
When a character is casting magic and has abilities and power sets as described in <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>, they can gather dice in the following way:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Description:</strong> Describe the intended <span class="setting term">result.</span><ul><li>The result and target must allow you to include at least one <span class="setting term">magic die</span>, whether it&#8217;s from your character sheet or an available asset.

Note that descriptions often prescribe an <span class="setting term">element</span> that must be present in the <span class="setting term">result</span> or <span class="setting term">target</span> when using that Ability.
See the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> <em>Modify Ability</em> for a way around this.</li><li><strong>Taxonomies:</strong> If the elements of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> apply to the target or result, include the taxonomy that most closely applies.

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_targeting">Targeting</h3><p>Magic takes on a nearly infinite variety of forms.
In some cases magic looks like a crone whispering in your ear, in others a well-dressed bookworm incomprehensibly shouting, and in still others a blast of light thrown from a wand.
Part of that difference comes from how a magician <span class="setting term">targets</span> the subject of the spell.
Over the centuries wizards have invented several ways to apply magic to a target, and each comes with its own fetures, advantages and disadvantages.
Below are the most common targeting methods and recommendations about what <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> they imply the character should use.
For the most part, targeting method determines which training die the player chooses, and what complications or assets might apply to that dies use.
When creating characters, it is a good idea to imagine what targeting types their magical school or training will favor.
There will always be exceptions and good ideas should be supported as long as they meet the requirements of the fiction.
Note that many magical items act automatically or are always on.
If it becomes necessary to determine a targeting method, touch is usually the right choice.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><a id="Contact" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>Contact</strong> - Available when the caster is in contact with, within, or otherwise directly connected to the target.
If the intended scale of the Result is large enough forests, cities, lakes etc. may count as a touched target as much as a small location can.
When choosing <span class="setting term">casting dice</span>, choose the attribute and training combination that best suits the actions the character is taking.
Some advice:<ul><li>Craft for creating magical items or when the act of creating an object creates magic.</li><li>Focus for quiet concentration.</li><li>Influence when magically changing a character&#8217;s mind.</li><li>Know when using sensory powers that require knowledge to interpret, such as Divination or Precognition.</li><li>Labor when the spell or ritual is an act of work with significant duration.</li><li>Move when the act of moving creates the magical result.</li><li>Notice when using sensory results to pick out details in a scene.</li><li>Operate for using complex magical items that require understanding of how to use them.</li><li>Perform for large rituals that require keeping the attention of an audience.</li><li>Sneak when being unseen is necessary to create the magic.
Unwilling targets may require <span class="setting trait">Fight</span>, often with <span class="setting trait">Hands</span> to keep in contact long enough for the spell to be cast.</li></ul></li><li><a id="Bolt" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>Bolt</strong> - The spell will be cast as a bolt, beam of energy, ribbon of light or other carrier that is sent through space to the target from the caster&#8217;s hands, wand, staff or other magical implement.
Dice pools may include mundane defenses such as armor or dodging since the bolt must physically fly to the target.
Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">hands</span> and <span class="setting trait">shoot#but if the target is willing or immobilized may use other [.cortex trait]#Attributes</span> or <span class="setting trait">experience</span>.</li><li><strong>Focus</strong> - The spell is cast upon a target that is visible, audible, or can otherwise be sensed with any sense that allows attention to be directed.
The caster must direct their gaze or attention on the sensation of the target, and any complications that might distract or obstruct the sense in question apply.
Dice Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">eyes</span> and <span class="setting trait">focus</span>.</li><li><strong>Affinity</strong> - This targeting technique allows a caster to cast a spell on a target that they cannot directly sense.
 Casting spells on a remote target feels appropriately magical, but if it is too easy it can seriously derail plotlines.
The GM should choose one or more of the following options depending upon how difficult they want this technique to be in their campaign:<ol class="arabic"><li>Require creation of a <span class="setting term">connection asset</span> before casting the spell. This connection asset should go both ways, so that attacking characters of similar skills with the <span class="setting term">affinity</span> method is dangerous.<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>Creating this asset should require a deep familiarity with the target, or an item meaningful to or once a part of the target. Collecting such items could be a great source of intrigue in a campaign that features espionage or paranoia. So you could create a connection asset to your childhood best friend easily, but would struggle to connect to the shopkeep you bought flour from last week. What counts as an appropriate item should be dependent upon the setting and technology. In some settings an image of the target may suffice, but the utility of imagery may be mystically devalued in a modern world of ubiquitous photography.</li><li>Items used as above might be rated with a die size, which could limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> of the connection asset.</li><li>The connection asset may be a bottleneck for the magic. In this case the connection asset may:<ol class="lowerroman" type="i"><li>Limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> to the connection asset die size.</li><li>Limit the size of or replace the <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> or <span class="setting term">magic dice</span>.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Affinity casting could require an SFX, consider the example below:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>SFX- <em>Affinity Casting:</em> Spend a <strong>pp</strong> to cast a spell on a remote target that you have an element of or significant relationship to.</li></ol></li><li>Make Affinity Casting impossible or a lost or secret technique known only to a few, or even declare it a technique that hasn&#8217;t been invented yet.</li></ol></li></ul></div>
