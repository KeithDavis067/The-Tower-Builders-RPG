<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_common_power_structure">Common Power Structure</h2><section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_magical_abilities_and_power_sets">Magical Abilities and Power Sets</h3><p>Most well trained magicians learn a set of practiced techniques that are reliable but limited, and most schools of magic require you to master at least a few before you graduate.
In terms of <span class="cortex">Cortex Prime</span>, these powers are somewhere between <span class="cortex term">powers</span> and <span class="cortex term">abilities</span>.
They tend to assist with tests and contests by adding a die like <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span>, but can create superhuman results without relying on <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> as heavily as do <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span>.
All <span class="setting term">magical power sets</span> have the descriptor <span class="setting term">magical</span>.
Because it applies to all uses of magic in the setting, <span class="setting term">magical</span> is not a <span class="cortex trait">limit</span>, but deserves being spelled out for clarity.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><span class="setting term">Magical</span> - This power, ability, or power set is magical.
It represents a natural or learned ability to create or transform the occult nature of a <span class="setting term">target</span> to incredible results.
<span class="setting term">Magical abilities</span> have everything they need to modify the occult nature of the <span class="setting term">target</span> to acheive their <span class="setting term">result</span> as written in the power&#8217;s description.
All uses of magic require <span class="setting term">targeting</span>.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_magic_powers_and_sfx">Magic Powers and SFX</h4><p><span class="setting trait">Magical powers</span> should be treated like <span class="cortex term">abilities</span> and purchased with a <span class="cortex term">description</span> that defines the ability as explained for abilities in the Cortex Prime Handbook.
However, the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> rules for <span class="setting term">Magical Powers</span> are different than for <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span>.
Characters do not purchase <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> for Abilities, they access <span class="cortex term">SFX</span>-like abilities by <span class="setting term">casting.</span></p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_taxonomies">Taxonomies</h3><p>In addition to a <span class="setting term">Magical Power Set</span>, most well trained magicians will also have a <span class="cortex term">Power Set</span> called <span class="setting term">Taxonomies</span>.
Within the fiction of the setting, a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> is a powerful and deep mystical understanding of a worldview, or mapping of ideas, to the world. It shapes both their magic and way of thinking, and determines what is possible with their magic.
Each <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> creates a powerful set of symbols within the wizard&#8217;s mind that they may use to manipulate the material, metaphorical, or symbolic elements to which a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy&#8217;s</span> <span class="setting term">Symbols</span> apply.
Taxonomy is a generic term, but any way of organizing thought about the wold can be a taxonomy.
This includes patheons of deities, archetypal stories or myths, theories about the natural world.
While <span class="setting term">Magical Powers</span> create a <span class="setting term">result</span> exactly as their <span class="setting term">description</span> states, wizards can use Taxonomies to:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Create a <span class="setting term">result</span> that matches the elements or symbols of the Taxonomy.</li><li>To modify their Magical Abilities to have a different description for the purposes of a single <span class="setting term">result</span>.</li><li>Add to their pool when the description of a <span class="setting term">Magical Ability</span> <em>and</em> their <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> applies.</li></ul></div>
<p>The second option above is an <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> that all <span class="setting term">Taxonomy Sets</span> have for free called <em>Modify Power</em>.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><span class="cortex term">SFX</span> - <em>Modify Power</em>: When a Magical Power could assist a Taxonomy Power but the Magical Power does not apply to the correct element, step that Magical Power die down to include it in your pool.</p>
<p>To use a Taxonomy, the player must explain how their taxonomy applies to the magical result they are creating.
A taxonomy applies when its symbols apply to the Target of a result, or to the Result the character is trying to apply to the Target.
The GM usually determines what applies, although groups may determine this by vote or any other method if they prefer a shared approach.
Also, wizards may attempt to apply their taxonomies even when the application is weak or indirect.
When this happens the GM should allow the use of the Taxonomy but increase the difficulty of the test or contest, either by stepping up the difficulty dice or the resistance dice of the defending character.
Note that the GM should not step up the entire dice pool, just the base difficulty dice.
In the case of a contest, in which another character&#8217;s dice pool is resisting, step up the 1 or 2 dice that most directly resist the intended result.
In most cases this will be the <span class="cortex term">Attribute</span> and <span class="setting term">Training</span> that apply
When amending the description of a character&#8217;s Magical Ability, the GM should allow the use of the Taxonomy and Specialty dice that apply, but step up the difficulty of the test in this case as well.</p></section></section>

Test to restore.
Although magic items for spellcasters will usually be assets or signature assets, non-spellcasters may have power sets granted by items.
Hard to remove items such as armor should probably choose a limit that will apply more often.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - <em class="setting term">Unstable Magic (Growing Dread)</em> - Both 1 and 2 on your dice count as hitches when using a &lt;power set&gt; power.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - <em class="setting term">Exhausted</em> - Shutdown any &lt;power set&gt; power to gain a pp. Activate an opportunity to restore the power.</li></ul></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_common_magical_abilities">Common Magical Abilities</h2><p>Magical Abilities represent training in specific magical techniques, they are included in dice pools where the power could significantly affect the result.
As noted, the power&#8217;s description is defined when the power is purchased.</p>
<p>Powers are similar to <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span>, but interact with <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> differently.</p>
<div class="dlist horizonta"><dl><dt><span class="power">Divination</span></dt><dd>Form a question about a single object, item, character, place, or situation and select a taxonomy through which to receive the answer.
If you have an available taxonomy that applies to the answer, the GM should tell you to include it in your pool before rolling.
<span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - Deactivate this power and recieve a PP when you do not have access to your symbolic objects, appropriate entrails to read, or other requirements of your taxonomies.

<span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - Step down attributes that require your body to use this ability.</li><li><span class="power">(Blast)</span> - Use a specific kind of magic to attack.
When purchased this power should be given a name that describes the nature of the attack and implies what kind of stress or complications it can create.
Each attack should be purchased as a separate power, but normal rules of using <span class="setting term">taxonomies</span> for modification of <span class="setting term">results</span> apply.
<span class="example">Lighting Bolt, Shaken Confidence, Body Tremors.</span></li><li><span class="power">Summon &lt;Element&gt;</span> - Summon energy, matter, or an idea.
The energy or matter will behave normally in the setting.
Water will fall, heat will burn things and dissapate.
The effect die should determing the amount summoned. This power should not be limited to material things and could be purchased to summon emotions, ideas or imagined magical elements.
The GM should allow players to be creative, but should resist attempts to make "super elements" that accomplish what multiple powers would create without <span class="cortex term">Limits</span> that counterbalance the advantages.
[.example]#Greek Fire - Summon a fire that cannot be extinguished by water. Limit - Dangerous, 1&#8217;s and 2&#8217;s count as hitches for any dice pool including this power.</li><li><span class="power">&lt;Spirit&gt; Communication</span> - You can communicate with beings with no natural body.
