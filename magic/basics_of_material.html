An acorn could one day be a tree.
Because of the Law of the Path, the acorn&#8217;s occult nature includes that future tree.
So a Magician that wants to drop that acorn on the ground and have it grow instantly into a tree bring must the <em>future</em> occult nature of the acorn into its <em>current</em> nature.
That&#8217;s an example of manipulating the acorn&#8217;s occult nature.
A character might do that in one of many ways, such as by a using <span class="setting term">magical power</span> built from the <span class="cortex term">Time Control</span> <span class="cortex term">ability</span> or a power built around controlling nature or trees.</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to make an acorn into a magic acorn that turns a living target to stone.
Nowhere in the occult nature of an acorn is anything that is particularly stonelike.
But acorns can last a long time before they are planted and grow into a tree. Can we treat acorns as having an occult nature that includes hibernation or suspended life?
Certainly!
Broad definitions like this often create disagreement about when an object has a certain occult nature, and when it does not.
As a way to manage these challenges, if the <strong>GM</strong> or group decides that a use of an item&#8217;s occult nature is valid, but on the edge of what&#8217;s valid, you should increase the difficulty of any <span class="setting term">result</span> that uses a weak occult nature of that item.
This is necessarily a judgement call and each group will find its favorite ways of making that call.
Some groups will let the <strong>GM</strong> make the call alone, but others may put it up to a vote by the table.
However you would like to do it is up to your group.</p>
<p>So, back to magic acorns that turn people into stone.
An acorn might be able to force someone into hibernation, but that&#8217;s a far cry from stone.
80&#8217;s fantasy movies aside, what then is a good option for creating a stone inducing throwable weapon?
Pebbles are an obvious one, but even better would be a stone that was once a living thing or at least strongly related to a living thing.
Consider:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Petrified wood.</li><li>Kidney or bladder stones, or any of the various stones that come from a living thing.</li><li>Bones.</li><li>Seashells.</li></ul></div>
<p>All of the above are items that were once living, but are now stonelike.
They are each well suited for magic that turns living things to stone.
But we wanted magic not to turn someone into stone, but to create an item that, when thrown at a living target, turns it to stone.
Let&#8217;s put a pause on that and come back to it in <a href="magic items.html">magic items</a>.</p></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-06-06 18:52:34 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
