This can happen for many reasons, and we encourage GMs and Players to play around with including naturally magical things in their games.
But for the most part, the PC&#8217;s in Tower Builders will be spellworkers, wizards, witches, mages, warlocks and so on.
And spellworkers <strong>cast</strong>.
The following are some rules and suggestions for how the metaphysics of magic in Tower Builders should limit when <span class="setting term">Magical abilities</span> and <span class="setting term">elements</span> apply to your roll.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_what_casting_is">What Casting Is</h2><p><span class="system term">Casting</span> refers to the <em>activities</em> that a character undertakes to create a magical <span class="system term">Result</span>.
Casting is what you <em>do</em> to make magic happen.
In many cases, this will match what we see from popular fiction about magic: shouting in magic languages, gesturing with hands and magic wands, boiling up disgusting brews and so on.
But magical trait dice are dice like any others, and so should be available for inclusion in pools even when the character is not initiating a spell.
For instance, when they are defending against someone else&#8217;s spell it may not be clear that they are casting a spell of their own.
To clarify:
Casting is the activities you undertake to make magic happen.
This means that everything from the use of imagination and meditation, to carving symbols into stone, to undertaking a grand quest to save the queen can be casting.
It is the wizard&#8217;s intent (and years of magical study) that make it a magical act.
However, not just any activity is well suited for casting, the clever wizard will always select the casting methods that hit the sweet spot between ease, detail, time, cost, practicality, symbolism, and everything else.</p>
<p>The core of this is the <span class="cortex term">Limit</span> <span class="setting term">requires casting</span>. Any Power set that requires casting, should be unavailable when the character (not necessarily the player) can&#8217;t find a way to meet their own power&#8217;s casting needs.
Rather that write a long description of what&#8217;s required, characters should consider the description of their Magic Power distinction to be the core of this. This is where they decribe how their magic works in the broadest sense.
To complicate matters, you may sometimes feel like casting should be a different action than using the result.
Consider using magic to make yourself invisible to sneak past a guard.
You could:
* Choose a pool of</p>
<p>But there are a few universally applicable guidelines that everyone should use when considering what activities to choose for casting.</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Effort Matters</strong>.
The bigger and more grand the <span class="setting term">result</span>, the bigger and more grand the casting methods should be.
This is reflected in SFX that allow the character to take on extra effort (more time, fancier materials) to step up or double dice.
There are also SFX that step down dice when everything does not quite align.
But it&#8217;s also a general truth of magic, and can guide the GM in determining the base difficulty for casting.
See <a href="#Magical Style SFX">[Magical Style SFX]</a></li><li><strong>Symbolism</strong> matters.
The better the activity aligns with the intended <span class="setting term">result</span> the easier the spell.</li></ol></div>
<p>Along with the Requires Casting Limit, every magic power requires <span class="setting term">targeting</span>.
Targeting is explained in another section, but the method a character uses usually sets some requirements for the roll.
In system terms, it determines what dice you are using for casting and therefore what complications apply to the roll.
These <span class="setting term">"casting dice"</span> are usually one <span class="cortex term">attribute</span> and one <span class="setting term">training</span> trait.</p>
<p>When casting a spell, if the player is using a <span class="setting term">Magical Power</span> for a <span class="setting term">result</span> that matches its description, the power works as inended without explanation.
If the character is using a <span class="setting term">taxonomy power</span> the player should describe to the table what elements of the occult nature of the target you are changing, and have a source of any necessary occult nature that is not already present.
The player should also describe what the character is doing to create the magical result.
This does not always need to be detailed or unique, many powers will always work the same way, but it can be a lot of fun when improvising.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_example_casting">Example Casting</h3><div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Jerry&#8217;s character Isabel wants to give her loyal malamute, Rex, wings and increase his size so that she can use him to fly over Aurilia&#8217;s castle walls.
Being a docg, Rex has no connection to any creature that can fly and so no occult nature helpful for the <span class="setting term">Result</span>. This is how the conversation at the table might go:</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: So, I want to give Rex wings and make him big enough to ride.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, how are you going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Well, Isabel has her <span class="power trait">Bag of Many Components</span> which could have an feather of a large flying creature, and she has studied the <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> <span class="setting power">Nobility of Pastoral Life</span>, which should definitely have a <span class="setting term">Reference</span> for beasts of burden in it.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, great. This will be a test, and the base difficulty is two d8&#8217;s. So you have an <span class="setting term">elements</span> that could help your with flight or a riding animal?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> No, the only specialties I have are 'Oxen' and 'Self Sufficiency'. Does oxen count?</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Oxen would help him carry heavy weight, but being Oxen being large heavy animals, I think you&#8217;d cause yourself more trouble than that element is worth since you want to fly.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> Right, I won&#8217;t include it then.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, I&#8217;m going to up the difficulty to d10&#8217;s because I think a feather from a large enough bird might be pretty hard to keep from getting crushed in that bag. You get your casting dice, your 'Bag of Many Components' die, whatever distinctions apply, and your Pastoral Life die. How is Isabella casting this?</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> The usual improvisational rhyming, and I&#8217;ll stick the feathers to his shoulder blades with some tree resin.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Ok, so your casting dice are <strong class="trait">Voice</strong> and <span class="trait">Perform</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry:</strong> All right, so I have: The <span class="power trait">Villiage Witch</span> distinction die, <strong>Hands</strong> and <strong>Perform</strong> for casting, <span class="trait">Bag of Many Components</span> signature asset, and <span class="power trait">Nobility of Pastoral Life</span>.</p>
<p><strong>GM:</strong> Rolling difficulty dice . . .</p></div></div>
<p>As you can see above, the player needed to determine what Abilities and Taxonomy(s) they were using, <em>and</em> what the character was doing in the fiction to cast the spell.
These actions determined what dice were available for the roll.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_building_a_dice_pool">Building a Dice Pool</h2><p>Like anything in Cortex, the character&#8217;s goal determines the dice they can recruit for their dice pool.
When a character is casting magic and has abilities and power sets as described in <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>, they can gather dice in the following way:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Description:</strong> Describe the intended <span class="setting term">result.</span><ul><li>The result and target must allow you to include at least one <span class="setting term">magic die</span>, whether it&#8217;s from your character sheet or an available asset.
<strong>If you cannot find a magic die that could create the intended result and act on the target, your magic cannot help you.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Casting Dice:</strong> Select a <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> method appropriate to the ability and circumstances and choose an Attribute and Ability as <span class="setting term">Casting Dice</span>.<ul><li>If circumstances restrict a character from using the <span class="cortex term">Traits</span> recommended in <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> they may be able to choose other casting dice, but they may also consider switching targeting methods. Any <span class="cortex term">limit</span> that applies should be honored.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Complications</span> and <span class="cortex term">stress</span> on these traits apply as usual.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magic Dice:</strong> The intended <span class="setting term">result</span> or the <span class="setting term">target</span> determine the <span class="cortex term">distinction</span>, <span class="setting term">magical ability</span>, <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> and <span class="setting term">element</span> dice that may be included.<ul><li><strong>Distinctions:</strong> Characters will usually have a Distinction that describes their magic. This is the most obvious Distinction to use, but mundane distinctions may be more appropriate especially when <em>Hinder</em>-ing their efforts.</li><li><strong>Magical Abilities:</strong> If a magical ability&#8217;s description could create the result you may include it.
Note that descriptions often prescribe an <span class="setting term">element</span> that must be present in the <span class="setting term">result</span> or <span class="setting term">target</span> when using that Ability.
See the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> <em>Modify Ability</em> for a way around this.</li><li><strong>Taxonomies:</strong> If the elements of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> apply to the target or result, include the taxonomy that most closely applies.
If the taxonomy&#8217;s elements apply weakly, make the roll harder (choose a consistent method such as stepping down the die or improving the <span class="cortex term">opposition</span>'s pool).</li><li><strong>Elements:</strong> If an element die of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> applies to the target or result, include it as well.</li></ul></li></ol></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_targeting">Targeting</h2><p>When <span class="setting term">casting</span>, a character must choose how the magic reaches the <span class="setting term">target</span> of the magic.
Below are the most common targeting methods and recommendations about what <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> they imply the character should use.
There will always be exceptions and good ideas should be supported as long as they meet the requirements of the fiction.
Note that many magical items act automatically or are always on, and usually use <span class="setting term">touch</span> as their targeting method.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Touch</strong> - Available when the caster is in contact with, within, or otherwise directly connected to the target.
If the intended scale of the Result is large enough forests, cities, lakes etc. may count as a touched target as much as a small location can.
When choosing <span class="setting term">casting dice</span>, choose the atrribute and training combination that best suits the actions the character is taking.
Some advice:<ul><li>Craft for creating magical items.</li><li>Focus for quiet concentration.</li><li>Influence when magically changing a character&#8217;s mind.</li><li>Know when using sensory powers that require knowledge to interpret, such as Divination or Precognition.</li><li>Labor when the spell or ritual is an act of work with significant duration.</li><li>Move when the act of moving creates the magical result.</li><li>Notice when using sensory results to pick out details in a scene.</li><li>Operate for using complex magical items that require understanding of how to use them.</li><li>Perform for large rituals that require keeping the attention of an audience.</li><li>Sneak when being unseen is necessary to create the magic.
Unwilling targets may require <span class="setting trait">Hands</span> and/or <span class="setting trait">Fight</span> instead of other <span class="cortex term">Attribute</span> or <span class="setting trait">Traiting</span> dice to keep in contact long enough for the spell to be cast.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bolt</strong> - The spell will be cast as a bolt, beam of energy or other carrier that is sent to the target from the caster&#8217;s hands, wand, staff or other magical implement.
Test or contest pools may include mundane defenses such as armor or dodging since the bolt must physically fly to the target.
Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">hands</span> and <span class="setting trait">fight</span>, but if the target is willing they may use other <span class="cortex trait">Attributes</span> or <span class="setting trait">skills</span>.</li><li><strong>Focus</strong> - The spell is cast upon a target that is visible, audible, or can otherwise be sensed with any sense that allows attention to be directed.
The caster must direct their gaze or attention on the sensation of the target, and any complications that might distract or obstruct the sense in question apply.
Dice Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">eyes</span> and <span class="setting trait">focus</span>.</li><li><strong>Affinity</strong> - This targeting technique allows a caster to cast a spell on a target that they cannot directly sense.
 Casting spells on a remote target feels appropriately magical, but if it is too easy it can seriously derail plotlines.
The GM should choose one or more of the following options depending upon how difficult they want this technique to be in their campaign:<ol class="arabic"><li>Require creation of a <span class="setting term">connection asset</span> before casting the spell. This connection asset should go both ways, so that attacking characters of similar skills with the <span class="setting term">affinity</span> method is dangerous.<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>Creating this asset should require a deep familiarity with the target, or an item meaningful to or once a part of the target. Collecting such items could be a great source of intrigue in a campaign that features espionage or paranoia. So you could create a connection asset to your childhood best friend easily, but would struggle to connect to the shopkeep you bought flour from last week. What counts as an appropriate item should be dependent upon the setting and technology. In some settings an image of the target may suffice, but the utility of imagery may be mystically devalued in a modern world of ubiquitous photography.</li><li>Items used as above might be rated with a die size, which could limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> of the connection asset.</li><li>The connection asset may be a bottleneck for the magic. In this case the connection asset may:<ol class="lowerroman" type="i"><li>Limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> to the connection asset die size.</li><li>Limit the size of or replace the <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> or <span class="setting term">magic dice</span>.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Affinity casting could require an SFX, consider the example below:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>SFX- <em>Affinity Casting:</em> Spend a <strong>pp</strong> to cast a spell on a remote target that you have an element of or significant relationship to.</li></ol></li><li>Make Affinity Casting impossible or a lost or secret technique known only to a few, or even declare it a technique that hasn&#8217;t been invented yet.</li></ol></li></ul></div></section></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-04-28 14:39:57 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
