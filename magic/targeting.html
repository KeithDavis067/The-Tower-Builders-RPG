In some cases magic looks like a crone whispering in your ear, in others a well-dressed bookworm incomprehensibly shouting, and in still others a blast of light thrown from a wand.
Part of that difference comes from how a magician <span class="setting term">targets</span> the subject of the spell.
Over the centuries wizards have invented several ways to apply magic to a target, and each comes with its own fetures, advantages and disadvantages.
Below are the most common targeting methods and recommendations about what <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> they imply the character should use.
For the most part, targeting method determines which training die the player chooses, and what complications or assets might apply to that dies use.
When creating characters, it is a good idea to imagine what targeting types their magical school or training will favor.
There will always be exceptions and good ideas should be supported as long as they meet the requirements of the fiction.
Note that many magical items act automatically or are always on.
If it becomes necessary to determine a targeting method, touch is usually the right choice.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><a id="Contact" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>Contact</strong> - Available when the caster is in contact with, within, or otherwise directly connected to the target.
If the intended scale of the Result is large enough forests, cities, lakes etc. may count as a touched target as much as a small location can.
When choosing <span class="setting term">casting dice</span>, choose the attribute and training combination that best suits the actions the character is taking.
Some advice:<ul><li>Craft for creating magical items or when the act of creating an object creates magic.</li><li>Focus for quiet concentration.</li><li>Influence when magically changing a character&#8217;s mind.</li><li>Know when using sensory powers that require knowledge to interpret, such as Divination or Precognition.</li><li>Labor when the spell or ritual is an act of work with significant duration.</li><li>Move when the act of moving creates the magical result.</li><li>Notice when using sensory results to pick out details in a scene.</li><li>Operate for using complex magical items that require understanding of how to use them.</li><li>Perform for large rituals that require keeping the attention of an audience.</li><li>Sneak when being unseen is necessary to create the magic.
Unwilling targets may require <span class="setting trait">Fight</span>, often with <span class="setting trait">Hands</span> to keep in contact long enough for the spell to be cast.</li></ul></li><li><a id="Bolt" aria-hidden="true"></a><strong>Bolt</strong> - The spell will be cast as a bolt, beam of energy, ribbon of light or other carrier that is sent through space to the target from the caster&#8217;s hands, wand, staff or other magical implement.
Dice pools may include mundane defenses such as armor or dodging since the bolt must physically fly to the target.
Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">hands</span> and <span class="setting trait">shoot#but if the target is willing or immobilized may use other [.cortex trait]#Attributes</span> or <span class="setting trait">experience</span>.</li><li><strong>Focus</strong> - The spell is cast upon a target that is visible, audible, or can otherwise be sensed with any sense that allows attention to be directed.
The caster must direct their gaze or attention on the sensation of the target, and any complications that might distract or obstruct the sense in question apply.
Dice Pools usually include <span class="setting trait">eyes</span> and <span class="setting trait">focus</span>.</li><li><strong>Affinity</strong> - This targeting technique allows a caster to cast a spell on a target that they cannot directly sense.
 Casting spells on a remote target feels appropriately magical, but if it is too easy it can seriously derail plotlines.
The GM should choose one or more of the following options depending upon how difficult they want this technique to be in their campaign:<ol class="arabic"><li>Require creation of a <span class="setting term">connection asset</span> before casting the spell. This connection asset should go both ways, so that attacking characters of similar skills with the <span class="setting term">affinity</span> method is dangerous.<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>Creating this asset should require a deep familiarity with the target, or an item meaningful to or once a part of the target. Collecting such items could be a great source of intrigue in a campaign that features espionage or paranoia. So you could create a connection asset to your childhood best friend easily, but would struggle to connect to the shopkeep you bought flour from last week. What counts as an appropriate item should be dependent upon the setting and technology. In some settings an image of the target may suffice, but the utility of imagery may be mystically devalued in a modern world of ubiquitous photography.</li><li>Items used as above might be rated with a die size, which could limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> of the connection asset.</li><li>The connection asset may be a bottleneck for the magic. In this case the connection asset may:<ol class="lowerroman" type="i"><li>Limit the maximum <span class="cortex term">effect die</span> to the connection asset die size.</li><li>Limit the size of or replace the <span class="setting term">casting dice</span> or <span class="setting term">magic dice</span>.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Affinity casting could require an SFX, consider the example below:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>SFX- <em>Affinity Casting:</em> Spend a <strong>pp</strong> to cast a spell on a remote target that you have an element of or significant relationship to.</li></ol></li><li>Make Affinity Casting impossible or a lost or secret technique known only to a few, or even declare it a technique that hasn&#8217;t been invented yet.</li></ol></li></ul></div></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-05-22 15:32:31 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
