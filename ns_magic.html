In the Tower Builders setting, the world is physically much like our own, with particles making up everything we find around us and a logical universe that can be understood through thought and experimentation.
Alongside that material world, there is an invisible component that can influence and be influenced by the material world.
That invisible feature, or hidden foundation, of reality is called <span class="setting term">occult nature</span>.
<span class="term">occult nature</span> follows different rules than the material but is no less real.
Magic itself is simply the art and science of manipulating occult nature.
So when characters cast magic spells or use magic items to create results that would not happen directly from their actions, they are using a set of skills, techniques, and tools to manipulate the occult nature of their target to create a magical result.
Everything (including immaterial things) has an inherent invisible nature that is related to what it is, what it has been or will be, and its symbolic meaning.
By manipulating that invisible foundation or adding new kinds of invisible essence to it, you can change it or make it something new.
<strong>This is the core of magic.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean all societies that practice magic have realized this fundamental truth, but if the question of what is possible or how magic is done comes up, this is the default concept to return to.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_how_magic_works">How Magic Works</h2><p>Many magical abilities (see the <a href="#Magical Abilities">[Magical Abilities]</a> section) have a pretty narrow description.
They can be used in creative ways, but but they always have pretty much the same effect on the same kind of target.
Those <span class="cortex term">traits</span> are included in dice pools whenever their described effects could help with a test or contest, although see advice regarding <a href="#_casting">Casting</a> for what that use looks like.
Magicians motivated to have more flexibility spend much of their lives studying how to modify and create their own magical results.
(This is not, it should be noted, a result of birth or blessing.
Like any talent or skill, some take to it easily, some are driven to practice and study, and some never attempt it. But theoretically anyone can learn it given the right support.)</p>
<p>For the purpose of clarity:</p>
<p>A magical <span class="setting term">result</span> is the change or effect a character creates on a <span class="setting term">target</span>.
All of magic must:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Manipulate the occult nature of the <span class="setting term">target</span> to bring about the <span class="setting term">result</span> <strong>or</strong></li><li>Bring new occult nature to the <span class="setting term">target</span> to create the <span class="setting term">result</span> <strong>or</strong></li><li>a combination of both.</li></ol></div>
<p>Spellcasters that improvise with magic are using their understanding of the occult nature of things to modify their magical abilities or create new ones on the fly.
What kinds of occult nature they can manipulate, and what kinds of occult nature can they create determines what <span class="setting term">results</span> they can acheive when improvising.
Their magical traits and powers determine those details, usually through a Taxonomy Set a Material Components Sets (see <a href="#_characters_and_traits">[_characters_and_traits]</a>).</p>
<p>So, how does one know what occult nature is available in a target, and what kinds of results can be acheived?
The <span class="setting term">Three Laws of Magic</span> are our guide:</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</h2><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>The Law of Nature.</strong> A thing is what it is. This is why material components in magic are so useful.
By bringing in an herb, mineral, or other object into a spell you bring its occult nature or qualities into the spell.
It is also through this law that constructed things, including immaterial things like language, can become magical.
They can be made to be a magical thing.</li><li><strong>The Law of Path.</strong> The past, present, and future of an object are included in its occult nature.
A well known corollary, often referred to a law in its own right is:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>The Law of Contagion (or Contact) - Often stated as "once together, always together," it means that objects retain a connection after they are separated.</li></ol></li><li><strong>The Law of Perception.</strong> How an object is seen affects its occult nature.
This is the tricky one, fundamental to so much of the slipperyness of magic.
Perception is so flexible across culture, time and even a person&#8217;s mood in the moment that it is very hard for magic to remain truly stable across contexts.
Stated succinctly, wizards must always remember that:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li><strong>Context Matters.</strong></li></ol></li></ol></div>
<p>There are two ways a spellcaster can bring in occult nature that isn&#8217;t already available in the object or the environment:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Use a material object that has the occult nature they need as a component of the spell.</li><li>Use a Taxonomy to create the occult nature they need with their mind.</li></ol></div>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_material_components">Material Components</h3><p>Many wizards carry samples of materials around with them as a way of bringing occult nature to their target, creating results impossible with the occult nature available in the target or environment.
Take an acorn for example: Nowhere in its nature, future, past, or symbolic meaning lies occult nature that would turn a creature to stone.
But in the right conditions, they can be fossilized.
A wizard that understands that can wrap an acorn in a paste of the right kind of mud to eventually fossilize the acorn, and now its occult nature allows results that could turn a living being into stone.
The wizard has modified the acorn so that it can now act as a material component to turn a living being into stone.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_taxonomies">Taxonomies</h3><p>Of course, carrying around giant bags of materials is cumbersome.
Over centuries of research wizards have created other methods to create the occult nature they need for magic.
A trained spellcaster that understands magic can study nature, philosophy, history, literature, science or any other subject deeply enough that the occult nature of what they have studied can be created by their mind.
They can create the occult nature they need using incantation, writing, gestures, rituals, and other symbolic acts.
These deeply studied networks of ideas are called Taxonomies, and they are represented as powers usually in a type of Power Set called a Taxonomies Set.</p>
<p>Taxonomies are broad frameworks used to describe and understand the world.
They can be based on material things (such as a taxonomy called <span class="setting term">Weather</span>) or on metaphor (such as <span class="setting term">Greek Myth</span>).
Each taxonomy will have 4-10 <span class="setting term">elements</span> that are core parts of how those taxonomies map the world.
Weather might have Heat, Rain, Storm, Lightning, Fog, and Sun as Elements, where Greek Myth might have Hercules, Medusa, the Nimean Lion, and a few more.
A wizard that has studied Greek Myth, could confer the characteristic of Hercules to another character in order to grant them great strength <em>even if Hercules never physically existed</em>.
Characters may also have <span class="cortex term">specialties</span> of their Taxonomies that represent deeper study into specific <span class="setting term">Elements</span> of a taxonomy.
For example, a wizard with the Taxonomy <em>Green Myth</em> could use the story of Pygmalion, in which an artist loved his statue so deeply it came to life, to create acorns that turn people to stone.
The occult nature of transforming stone to life could be reversed by whispering magical words to the acorn, imbueing it with the ability to turn life into stone.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_casting">Casting</h2><p>The above sections are mostly to explain the fiction of magic in the setting.
This section describes how a spell is cast, but magical traits will be covered in <a href="#Characters and Traits">[Characters and Traits]</a>.
When a character is involved in a test or contest, the dice you include in their pool is determined by their approach to the challenge within the fiction of the scene.
So the above sections about the fiction of magic determine what dice are available.
First and foremost:</p>
<p><strong><span class="setting term">Magical Abilities</span> always provide and manipulate whatever occult nature they need when used according to their description and <span class="cortex term">Limits</span>.</strong>
These are abilites that are so well practiced they always create the described results on the described targets.
If it is ever unclear whether a Magical Ability can help a test or contest use <a href="#_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</a> to determine whether the target or result has an occult nature affected by the ability.</p>
<p>It is when a character is <em>modifying</em> or <em>creating</em> a Magical Ability that they need a Taxonomy Power (or Element Specialty) or Material Component to provide or manipulate the occult nature they need for the result or target.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_building_a_dice_pool">Building a Dice Pool</h3><p>Like anything in Cortex, the character&#8217;s goal determines the dice they can recruit for their dice pool.
When a character is casting magic and has abilities and power sets as described in <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>, they can gather dice in the following way:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Description:</strong> Describe the intended <span class="setting term">result.</span><ul><li>The result and target must allow you to include at least one <span class="setting term">magic die</span>, whether it&#8217;s from your character sheet or an available asset.
<strong>If you cannot find a magic die that could create the intended result and act on the target, your magic cannot help you.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Casting Dice:</strong> Select a <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> method appropriate to the <span class="setting term">Ability</span> and circumstances and choose an <span class="cortex term">Attribute</span> and ability as <span class="setting term">Casting Dice</span>.<ul><li>If circumstances restrict a character from using the <span class="cortex term">Traits</span> recommended in <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> they may be able to choose other casting dice, but they may also consider switching targeting methods. Any <span class="cortex term">limit</span> that applies should be honored.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Complications</span> and <span class="cortex term">stress</span> on these traits apply as usual.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magic Dice:</strong> The intended <span class="setting term">result</span> or the <span class="setting term">target</span> determine the <span class="cortex term">distinction</span>, <span class="setting term">magical ability</span>, <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> and <span class="setting term">element</span> dice that may be included.<ul><li><strong>Distinctions:</strong> Characters will usually have a Distinction that describes their magic. This is the most obvious Distinction to use, but mundane distinctions may be more appropriate especially when <em>Hinder</em>-ing their efforts.</li><li><strong>Magical Abilities:</strong> If a magical ability&#8217;s description could create the result you may include it.
Note that descriptions often prescribe an <span class="setting term">element</span> that must be present in the <span class="setting term">result</span> or <span class="setting term">target</span> when using that Ability.
See the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> <em>Modify Ability</em> for a way around this.</li><li><strong>Taxonomies:</strong> If the elements of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> apply to the target or result, include the taxonomy that most closely applies.
If the taxonomy&#8217;s elements apply weakly, make the roll harder (choose a consistent method such as stepping down the die or improving the <span class="cortex term">opposition</span>'s pool).</li><li><strong>Elements:</strong> If an element die of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> applies to the target or result, include it as well.</li></ul></li></ol></div></section>
