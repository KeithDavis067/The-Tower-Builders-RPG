This is a sort of introduction document, to help new players learn the core ideas and rules.
Note that there is a glossary at the end of the document.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_the_setting_in_a_nutshell">The Setting in a Nutshell</h2><p>Imagine a future world, where powerful wizards have bonded with spirit beings in a non hierachical nearly perfect society.
A magical utopia that exists in the spirit world and in material realms constructed to be perfect places to live without material want of any kind.
Imagine that the people born to this world look across the infinite planes and planets and see pain, suffering, and infinite need.
What would they do?
What would you do, if you had that kind of power?
What moral constraints would you place upon your own use of that power?
How would you help when your own ethics of equality forbid you from placing yourself over others, but the infinite power of your society makes you godlike compared to the people you might want to help.</p>
<p>That is the endpoint of the Tower Builders setting, so called by future archeaologists that study the massive towers they once built for magical purposes.
They eventually create world where human but powerful beings and their spirit companions reach out to other worlds to nudge them in the direction of better societies.
Those efforts are not without challenges.
In the meantime, how could we get there?
The following rules and setting is not about that imagined endpoint, where legendary beings known mysterously as "Those Who Build Towers" meddle in the affairs of mortals.
This setting is about the first era, before they even began to build.
A group of ordinary people touched by and studying the vast power of magic begin to dream of a world better than their own.</p>
<p>The first era could be called <strong>Exploration and Consolidation</strong>.
When we join the characters that you will play, we find them trained or at least touched by a kind of magic can can be developed, invented, and improved.
They look around their world, and see a history of wizards serving kings, shahs, warlords, village tyrants, councils of selfish men that ignore and oppress a populace as tools for their own power.
Inside their hearts forms a hope that if they could band together and build an ethical way of life, perhaps they could end misery. They imagine a world in which magic takes care of everyone creating a lasting peace that without standing atop the backs of the unfortunate many.</p>
<p>Your chracters will be magicians, witches, wizards, sorcerers, warriors, caretakers and so forth that have ventured out into their world to take the great risk of making it better.
Their magic isn&#8217;t all powerful, and has a recent history of causing disaster.
So they will have to reach out to others and find those that see a future world where people are taken care of, equal, and free.
You characters will be those that risk their lives for the hope of a future.</p>
<p>The Exploration Era follows a magical apocalypse in which great empires have fallen, and some of the magical community feels a great guilt at it&#8217;s role in the crisis.
This is an early medieval world, trying to find its way after emporers have fallen and local tyrants are trying to take control.
The apocalyps left vast power vacuums filled by petty warlords using the remnants of the previous magical age to support their dreams of new empires.
They will spill as much blood as they need to to grab control.
But there are new teachers and magical schools training a new generation in magic, peaceful people building caring societies, and attempts to discover how magic can be used for the health and happiness of all.
Who will you be in a world just at the beginnings of a Great Project. How will you start to build a peaceful new society, while protecting it from the violence and manipulation of those who would return it to the past?</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_magic_in_a_nutshell">Magic in a Nutshell</h2><p>Magic is core to the setting of the tower builders, and it&#8217;s important to udnerstand how it functions, both for the character&#8217;s abilities and within the fiction, this section hopes to explain that briefly, see <a href="#Magic">[Magic]</a> for a more detailed look.</p>
<p>Magic in the tower builders is the fraternal twin of science.
In the Tower Builders setting, the world is physically much like our own, with particles making up everything we find around us and a logical universe that can be understood through thought and experimentation.
Alongside that material world, there is an invisible component that can influence and be influenced by the material world.
That invisible feature, or hidden foundation,  of reality is called <span class="setting term">occult nature</span>.
<span class="term">occult nature</span> follows different rules than the material but is no less real.
Magic is simply the art and science of manipulating occult nature.
So when characters cast magic spells or use magic items to create results that would be impossible physically, they are using a set of skills, techniques, and tools to manipulate the occult nature of their target to create a magical result.
Everything (including immaterial things) has an inherent invisible nature that is related to what it is, what it has been or will be, and its symbolic meaning.
By manipulating that invisible foundation or adding new kinds of invisible essence to it, you can change it or make it something new.
<strong>This is the core of magic.</strong></p>
<p>This does not mean all societies that practice magic have realized this fundamental truth, but if the question of what&#8217;s possible or how magic is done comes up, this is the default concept to return to.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_how_magic_works">How Magic Works</h3><p>Many magical abilities (see the <a href="#_magical_abilities">Magical Abilities</a> section) have a pretty narrow description.
They can be used in creative ways, but but they always have pretty much the same effect on the same kind of target.
Those <span class="cortex term">traits</span> are included in dice pools whenever their described effects could help with a test or contest, although see advice regarding <a href="#casting">[casting]</a> for what that use looks like.
Magicians motivated to have more flexibility spend much of their lives studying how to modify and create their own magical results.
(This is not, it should be noted, a result of birth or blessing.
Like any talent or skill, some take to it easily, some are driven to practice and study, and some never attempt it. But theoretically anyone can learn it given the right support.)</p>
<p>For the purpose of clarity:</p>
<p>A magical <span class="setting term">result</span> is the change or effect a character creates on a <span class="setting term">target</span>.
All of magic must:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Manipulate the occult nature of the <span class="setting term">target</span> to bring about the <span class="setting term">result</span> <strong>or</strong></li><li>Bring new occult nature to the <span class="setting term">target</span> to create the <span class="setting term">result</span> <strong>or</strong></li><li>a combination of both.</li></ol></div>
<p>Spellcasters that improvise with magic are using their understanding of the occult nature of things to modify their magical abilities or create new ones on the fly.
What kinds of occult nature they can manipulate, and what kinds of occult nature can they create determines what <span class="setting term">results</span> they can acheive when improvising.
Their magical traits and powers determine those details, usually through a Taxonomy Set a Material Components Sets (see <a href="#_characters_and_traits">Characters and Traits</a>).</p>
<p>So, how does one know what occult nature is available in a target, and what kinds of results can be acheived?
The <span class="setting term">Three Laws of Magic</span> are our guide:</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</h3><div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>The Law of Nature.</strong> A thing is what it is. This is why material components in magic are so useful.
By bringing in an herb, mineral, or other object into a spell you bring its occult nature or qualities into the spell.
It is also through this law that constructed things, including immaterial things like language, can become magical.
They can be made to be a magical thing.</li><li><strong>The Law of Path.</strong> The past, present, and future of an object are included in its occult nature.
A well known corollary, often referred to a law in its own right is:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li>The Law of Contagion (or Contact) - Often stated as "once together, always together," it means that objects retain a connection after they are separated.</li></ol></li><li><strong>The Law of Perception.</strong> How an object is seen affects its occult nature.
This is the tricky one, fundamental to so much of the slipperyness of magic.
Perception is so flexible across culture, time and even a person&#8217;s mood in the moment that it is very hard for magic to remain truly stable across contexts.
Stated succinctly, wizards must always remember that:<ol class="loweralpha" type="a"><li><strong>Context Matters.</strong></li></ol></li></ol></div>
<p>There are two ways a spellcaster can bring in occult nature that isn&#8217;t already available in the object or the environment:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>Use a material object that has the occult nature they need as a component of the spell.</li><li>Use a Taxonomy to create the occult nature they need with their mind.</li></ol></div>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_material_components">Material Components</h4><p>Many wizards carry samples of materials around with them as a way of bringing occult nature to their target, creating results impossible with the occult nature available in the target or environment.
Take an acorn for example: Nowhere in its nature, future, past, or symbolic meaning lies occult nature that would turn a creature to stone.
But in the right conditions, they can be fossilized.
A wizard that understands that can wrap an acorn in a paste of the right kind of mud to eventually fossilize the acorn, and now i/in asts occult nature allows results that could turn a living being into stone.
The wizard has modified the acorn so that it can now act as a material component to turn a living being into stone.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_taxonomies">Taxonomies</h4><p>Of course, carrying around giant bags of materials is cumbersome.
Over centuries of research wizards have created other methods to create the occult nature they need for magic.
A trained spellcaster that understands magic can study nature, philosophy, history, literature, science or any other subject deeply enough that the occult nature of what they have studied can be created by their mind.
They can create the occult nature they need using incantation, writing, gestures, rituals, and other symbolic acts.
These deeply studied networks of ideas are called Taxonomies, and they are represented as powers usually in a type of Power Set called a Taxonomies Set.</p>
<p>Taxonomies are broad frameworks used to describe and understand the world.
They can be based on material things (such as a taxonomy called <span class="setting term">Weather</span>) or on metaphor (such as <span class="setting term">Greek Myth</span>).
Each taxonomy will have 4-10 <span class="setting term">elements</span> that are core parts of how those taxonomies map the world.
Weather might have Heat, Rain, Storm, Lightning, Fog, and Sun as Elements, where Greek Myth might have Hercules, Medusa, the Nimean Lion, and a few more.
A wizard that has studied Greek Myth, could confer the characteristic of Hercules to another character in order to grant them great strength <em>even if Hercules never physically existed</em>.
Characters may also have <span class="cortex term">specialties</span> of their Taxonomies that represent deeper study into specific <span class="setting term">Elements</span> of a taxonomy.
For example, a wizard with the Taxonomy <em>Green Myth</em> could use the story of Pygmalion, in which an artist loved his statue so deeply it came to life, to create acorns that turn people to stone.
The occult nature of transforming stone to life could be reversed by whispering magical words to the acorn, imbueing it with the ability to turn life into stone.</p></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_how_to_cast_magic">How to Cast Magic</h3><p>The above sections are mostly to explain the fiction of magic in the setting.
This section describes how a spell is cast, but magical traits will be covered in <a href="#_characters_and_traits">Characters and Traits</a>.
When a character is involved in a test or contest, the dice you include in their pool is determined by their approach to the challenge within the fiction of the scene.
So the above sections about the fiction of magic determine what dice are available.
First and foremost:</p>
<p><strong><span class="setting term">Magical Abilities</span> always provide and manipulate whatever occult nature they need when used according to their description and <span class="cortex term">Limits</span>.</strong>
These are abilites that are so well practiced they always create the described results on the described targets.
If it is ever unclear whether a Magical Ability can help a test or contest use <a href="#_the_laws_of_magic">The Laws of Magic</a> to determine whether the target or result has an occult nature affected by the ability.</p>
<p>It is when a character is <em>modifying</em> or <em>creating</em> a Magical Ability that they need a Taxonomy Power (or Element Specialty) or Material Component to provide or manipulate the occult nature they need for the result or target.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_building_a_dice_pool">Building a Dice Pool</h4><p>Like anything in Cortex, the character&#8217;s goal determines the dice they can recruit for their dice pool.
When a character is casting magic and has abilities and power sets as described in <a href="Magic Powers.html">magic powers</a>, they can gather dice in the following way:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li><strong>Description:</strong> Describe the intended <span class="setting term">result.</span><ul><li>The result and target must allow you to include at least one <span class="setting term">magic die</span>, whether it&#8217;s from your character sheet or an available asset.
<strong>If you cannot find a magic die that could create the intended result and act on the target, your magic cannot help you.</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Casting Dice:</strong> Select a <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> method appropriate to the ability and circumstances and choose an Attribute and Ability as <span class="setting term">Casting Dice</span>.<ul><li>If circumstances restrict a character from using the <span class="cortex term">Traits</span> recommended in <a href="#_targeting">Targeting</a> they may be able to choose other casting dice, but they may also consider switching targeting methods. Any <span class="cortex term">limit</span> that applies should be honored.</li><li><span class="cortex term">Complications</span> and <span class="cortex term">stress</span> on these traits apply as usual.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magic Dice:</strong> The intended <span class="setting term">result</span> or the <span class="setting term">target</span> determine the <span class="cortex term">distinction</span>, <span class="setting term">magical ability</span>, <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> and <span class="setting term">element</span> dice that may be included.<ul><li><strong>Distinctions:</strong> Characters will usually have a Distinction that describes their magic. This is the most obvious Distinction to use, but mundane distinctions may be more appropriate especially when <em>Hinder</em>-ing their efforts.</li><li><strong>Magical Abilities:</strong> If a magical ability&#8217;s description could create the result you may include it.
Note that descriptions often prescribe an <span class="setting term">element</span> that must be present in the <span class="setting term">result</span> or <span class="setting term">target</span> when using that Ability.
See the <span class="cortex term">SFX</span> <em>Modify Ability</em> for a way around this.</li><li><strong>Taxonomies:</strong> If the elements of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> apply to the target or result, include the taxonomy that most closely applies.
If the taxonomy&#8217;s elements apply weakly, make the roll harder (choose a consistent method such as stepping down the die or improving the <span class="cortex term">opposition</span>'s pool).</li><li><strong>Elements:</strong> If an element die of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> applies to the target or result, include it as well.</li></ul></li></ol></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_targeting">Targeting</h4><p>See the external <a href="./magic/targeting.html">Targeting</a> document.</p></section></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_characters_and_traits">Characters and Traits</h2><p>Characters in the tower builders are expected to have a relationship to magic.
That relationship is usually described in one of their Distinctions, and will either describe their magical training, a magical object that grants them powers, or a relationship with a spiritual being that grants them powers.
If the themes of the setting are a part of your GM&#8217;s scenario, characters should have a personality, temperament, or history that makes them part of a society that is looking to make a better future for humanity via magic.
Or they should at least have goals that align with characters pursueing that Grand Dream.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_traits">Traits</h3><p>Characters have fairly standard <span class="cortex term">trait sets</span> for Cortex.
Those sets are: <span class="cortex term">Distinctions</span>, <span class="cortex term">Attributes</span>, and <span class="setting term">Training</span> (which are slightly modified <span class="cortex term">skills</span>).
They will also have one or more Power Sets, depending upon their relationship to magic.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_distinctions">Distinctions</h4><p>Characters will have 3 Distinctions, each with <em>Hinder</em>. Characters will usually have one Distinction describing their history, one describing their connection to or training in magic, and one describing their destiny, goals, or future.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_attributes">Attributes</h4><p>The Standard Attributes are each a combination of a practical real-world sense or ability, and a metaphorical meaning.</p>
<div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt>Head</dt><dd>Reason and understanding. Competence at understanding complexity and learning.</dd><dt>Hands</dt><dd>Competence with projecting the body into the world, including labor, fighting, and crafting.</dd><dt>Heart</dt><dd>Strength of passion, confidence, and willpower. Compassion for others and the strength of your own passions.</dd><dt>Voice</dt><dd>Projection of yourself into the world, communication skills, charisma, and making your inner self heard.</dd><dt>Eyes</dt><dd>Perceptiveness, including willingness and skill at listening to others.</dd></dl></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_the_training_set">The Training Set</h4><p>The Training Set is pretty much a copy of Skills from the Cortex Handbook with a few modified for the setting.
These Traits should always be subjects a character has experience with, even if that training is not formal schooling.
Training Traits are broad, but most characters will have experience with only a small range of the applications of each.
Interpret each Training through the history of the character to determine what parts of it they can use.
For simplicity&#8217;s sake, each Training includes any magical uses of its skills <em>if</em> the character has a reason to know magical applications.
For instance, Craft can be used to build costume jewelry and jewelry that can be made magical.
A wizard character will know Craft <em>primarily for the purposes of magic</em>, which does grant some mundane crafting skills, but they will always be more comfortable and knowledgeable when using crafting for magic.
Refer to the character&#8217;s Distinctions when there is a question.
For instance, if the above character&#8217;s distinctions indicate that they were first a mundane woodworker before studying magic, their knowledge of craft extends to mundane construction as well.
GMs may deny use of these skills when not appropriate for a character, or increase the difficulty of tests.</p>
<div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt>Craft</dt><dd>How to make things. This can include magical items.
Craft may also be included in pools when rituals or spells require making things as a part of the spell, even when the outcome is not a magical item.</dd><dt>Drive</dt><dd>Driving surface conveyances with which the character is familiar, magical or otherwise. Includes riding animals.</dd><dt>Fight</dt><dd>As in the Cortex Handbook, but include magical fighting and when using wands or other casting implements in melee.</dd><dt>Fix</dt><dd>Repairing items with which the character is familiar.</dd><dt>Fly</dt><dd>Piloting flying things the character is familiar with, magical or otherwise. Includes riding flying beasts.</dd><dt>Focus</dt><dd>Concentration and ignoring distractions, as well as meditation.

<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_magical_power_traits">Magical Power Traits</h3><p>Magical Powers can get detailed, in part beause there are many ways to be creative with how they are grouped together into <span class="cortex term">Power Sets</span>.
There are three different kinds of Magical Power Traits: <a href="#_magical_abilities">Magical Abilities</a>, <a href="#_taxonomies">Taxonomies</a>, and <a href="#_material_components">Material Components</a> but the last two play much the same role in magic, as described below.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_magical_abilities">Magical Abilities</h4><p>Magical Abilities are supernormal abilities granted to the character by some source of magic, whether that source is training, a magical item, gifts of a spiritual being or any source that makes sense within the setting.
Compared to Taxonomies, Abilities are limited, providing one specific ability on a defined kind of target: 'they do what they say on the tin,' as it were.
In power level and scope they are somewhere betweeen Powers and Abilities from the Corted Prime Handbook.
Their scale is smaller than Powers, but they can create Results similar to the SFX attached to Abilities without buying access from a list of SFX.
Most of the uses of Abilities that the handbook lists as SFX are available by spending a PP or as test-created assets or results with some exceptions determined by the GM.
See the main text for details on constructing Abilities.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_examples">Examples:</h5><div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt><span class="ability">Divination</span></dt><dd>Form a question about a single object, item, character, place, or situation and select a taxonomy through which to receive the answer.
If you have an available taxonomy that applies to the answer, the GM should tell you to include it in your pool before rolling.
<span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - Deactivate this power and recieve a PP when you do not have access to your symbolic objects, appropriate entrails to read, or other requirements of your taxonomies.
The focus of the question must be present or <span class="setting term">targeted</span>.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Clairsentience</span></dt><dd>Shut down your senses locally to use them in a location you can <span class="setting term">target</span>.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Planar Shift</span></dt><dd>(Density Decrease) You shift your body partially into another plane. Describe the plane you shift into and the properties and limits that plane applies to you while shifted.
Create a temporary asset or spend a PP to shift into the dimensional plane completely.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Summon &lt;Element&gt;</span></dt><dd>Summon energy, matter, or an idea.
The energy or matter will behave normally in the setting, e.g. water will fall and heat will burn things and dissipate.
The effect die determines the amount summoned.
This power should not be limited to material things and could be purchased to summon emotions, ideas or imagined magical elements.
The GM should allow players to be creative, but should resist attempts to make "super elements" that accomplish what multiple powers would create without <span class="cortex term">Limits</span> that counterbalance the advantages.
<span class="ability example">Greek Fire</span> - Summon a fire that cannot be extinguished by water. Limit - Dangerous, 1&#8217;s and 2&#8217;s count as hitches for any dice pool including this power.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Teleportation</span></dt><dd>You can teleport without crossing the space between you and any location you can <span class="setting term">Target</span>.
Include this die when you can cast and moving quickly can help you succeed.
The GM may impose limits based on the size of this die or an effect die.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Create &lt;Servitor&gt;</span></dt><dd>You benefit from being able to create a helper.
Include this die when you can cast and a helper would assist in a test or contest.
Deactivate this power to grant its die to other characters or create an asset to retain it.</dd></dl></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_taxonomies_2">Taxonomies</h5><p>In Cortex terms, a Taxonomy is a Power Trait similar to the Sorcery Power from the Cortex Handbook.
It creates and manipulates "magical forces" as appropriate to the setting (see <a href="#_how_magic_works">How Magic Works</a>).
Because of how magic works in the Tower Builders setting, Taxonomies determine what results and targets a character can affect with magic unless they are using a Magical Ability.
Taxonomies are more flexible than magical abilities.
They can create a range of results on a range of targets because they manipulate occult nature consciously and directly.
Taxonomies can be based on any major field of human study including: Science, naturalism, philosophy, art, religion, literature, athletics, mythology and artisanship.
Even culinary arts is a valid foundation for a Taxonomy.
Each Taxonomy should be a subset of its field of study (sorry, you cannot have all of Nature as a Taxonomy)
and usually have between five and a dozen Elements.
Elements are the fundamental parts of how a Taxonomy describes the world, and serve to specify what interpretation of the Taxonomy name applies.
Characters may have more than one taxonomy and have elements of the taxonomies as specialties of their taxonomy trait.
If a character is learning a new taxonomy, thay may start by taking element traits first.
While learning, those are the only elements of the taxonomy they can <span class="setting term">reference</span>.
When a character learns enough elements to graduate to understanding the taxonomy, the points spend on elements can be traded in for the taxomony, representing a more rounded understanding of the taxonomy.
Further study can bring the Element specialties back as they deepen their knowledge of subsets of the Taxonomies.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_material_components_2">Material components</h5><p>Most wizards will use some form of material component occaisionally, but many schools will spend most of their time developing strong and powerful Taxonomies.
Wizards that emphasize Taxonomies may carry small bags of Material Components to create Results or affect Targets that their Taxonomies reference poorly.
These characters should purchase <span class="cortex term">signature assets</span> or <span class="cortex term">resources</span> to represent this, and those dice should usually be no more than a d6.
Note these on character sheets as a 'Bag of Feathers', 'Bag of Forest Items' or other 'Bag of &lt;component type&gt;'.</p>
<p>Some wizards will be so strongly committed to material components that they will port around large caches of materials for use in magic.
In that case, instead of (or in addition to, they can have both) Taxonomy Traits they will have Traits that represent collections of types of materials.
They may have a mule carrying baskets of 'Botanical Samples' or a 'Crystal Collection' in their pack and the practical effects of carrying around so much material should be taken into account.
Practical problems are a good source of ideas for <span class="setting term">Limits</span> on power sets that represent material components.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_magical_power_sets">Magical Power Sets</h5><p>Power Sets group Power traits together with Limits and SFX to create a theme for a Power.
Limits are specific times when the power does not work, or complications that apply under certain circumstances.
In the Tower Builders, characters may have one or several Power Sets depending upon the source and theme of their powers.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><strong>Remember that a character usually only gets one die per Power Set, so there is an advantage in multiple sets.</strong></p>
<section class="doc-section level-5"><h6 id="_non_improvisational_sets">Non-Improvisational Sets.</h6><p>Some power sets will only have magical abilities.
Characters that cannot improvise or modify magical abilities will <strong>only</strong> have magical abilities.
They may have more than one power set.
Multiple power sets may add one ability each, when both abilities would significantly affect a test or contest.
This is a good choice for characters with little to no magical training that have been granted their powers by a magical item(s) or the patronage of a powerful magical being or wizard.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>After witnessing the traumatic destruction of their villiage, a warrior has a vision of an Angel of Vengeance, which promises to aid their quest for vengeance as long as they act with honor to the peaceful. They create two power sets:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><span class="setting power">Angelic Armor</span> representing the angel&#8217;s protection.<ul><li>Limit: <em>Angel&#8217;s Averted Gaze: Shut down Angelic Armor and gain a PP. Test to renew your honor and restore</em>.</li><li>&lt;A defensive ability&gt;</li><li>&lt;Another defensive ability&gt;</li><li>&lt;etc&gt;</li></ul></li><li><span class="setting power">Angel&#8217;s Fury</span><ul><li>Limit: <em>The Fury Knows No Limits (Uncontrollable): Both 1 and 2 on your dice counts as hitches when using an Angel&#8217;s Fury Ability</em>,</li><li>&lt;Swordlike ability 1&gt;</li><li>&lt;Swordlike ability 2&gt;</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>
<p>Characters trained in magic should also take Power Sets with only magical abilities, those represent the practiced spells from their training that are very reliable.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Celeste the Bright began their training at the age of ten and has mastered many spells in that practice.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Practiced Spells</strong><ul><li>Limit: <em>Exhausted: Shut down Magical Training to gain a PP. Activate an Opportunity to reactivate.</em></li><li><em>Lighting Flash</em></li><li><em>Zephyr</em>:</li><li><em>Sun&#8217;s Rage</em></li><li><em>Teleport</em></li><li><em>Divination</em></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-5"><h6 id="_improvisational_sets">Improvisational Sets</h6><p>Some power sets will provide the improvisational abilities of trained magic by representing taxonomies or available material components.
Since Taxonomies and Material Components act directly through manipulation and creation of occult nature, they are far more flexible than abilities, but are more complicated and dangerous to use.
(They also are a little more costly at character creation and development.)
They also make other abilities more flexible, by providing the <em>Modify Ability</em> SFX.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><span class="cortex term">SFX</span> - <em>Modify Ability</em>: Step down a Magical Ability to include it in pools when using an &lt;Improvisational Power Set&gt; power to create a result that matches the Ability&#8217;s purpose, but not its occult nature.</p>
<p>In other words: <em>Modify Ability</em> allows a character to use an ability as if it had a description that aligned with the character&#8217;s taxonomy.
That overall effect of the ability must remain the same, usually this will change the Element the ability creates or targets.</p>
<p>Define the differences between Material Components power sets and Taxonomy power sets via their limits.</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Aphor the Wanderer is never seen without massive pack. Within it he carries his:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Crystal Library</strong><ul><li>Limit - <em>Fragile Collection: Gain a PP when you deactivate this power (for instance if a significant crystal is broken or if you cannot access your pack). Test to reactivate.</em></li><li><span class="cortex term">SFX</span> - <em>Modify Ability</em>: Step down a Magical Ability to include it in pools when using an &lt;Improvisational Power Set&gt; power to create a result that matches the Ability&#8217;s purpose, but not its occult nature.</li><li><em>Volcanic Glasses</em> - Volcanic glasses of various colors provide occult nature for the following Elements: <em>Sharpness</em>, <em>Fragility</em>, <em>Heat</em>, <em>Pressure</em>.</li><li><em>Regular Crystals</em> - Crystals with regular forms provide occult nature for the following Elements: Order, Stength, Clarity, Resonance, Spectrum.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Celeste the Bright has also studied a few Taxonomies:</p>

After casting, the system result of the effect of a successful spell such as an <span class="cortex term">asset</span> or <span class="cortex term">complication</span>.</dd><dt><a id="MagicalPower" aria-hidden="true"></a>Magical Power</dt><dd>A <span class="cortex term">Power</span> or <span class="cortex term">Ability</span> that follows the rules of magic for the setting.</dd><dt><a id="MagicalPowerSet" aria-hidden="true"></a>Magical Power Set</dt><dd>A Power Set that collects a set of magical powers and abilities thall are all a use of the same core feature, training, or magical item.</dd><dt><a id="TaxonomiesSet" aria-hidden="true"></a>Taxonomies Set</dt><dd>A <span class="cortex term">power set</span> that collects all of the <span class="cortex term">powers</span> and <span class="cortex term">specialties</span> that represent a character&#8217;s known taxonomies.</dd><dt><a id="TaxonomyPower" aria-hidden="true"></a>Taxonomy Power</dt><dd>A <span class="cortex term">power</span> that represents a particular view and description of the physical, magical, or symbolic components of the world.
A taxonomy comprises a set of <span class="setting term">elements</span> it treats as fundamental and can be used to magically change a <span class="setting term">target</span> that matches the <span class="setting term">element</span> or give a property of one of those <span class="setting term">elements</span> to a <span class="setting term">target</span>.</dd><dt><a id="Taxonomy" aria-hidden="true"></a>Taxonomy</dt><dd>A description of the elements of the world and how that interact both naturally and unnaturally.

For example, the Taxonomy <span class="setting power">Forest Life</span> will be able to create results on or related to snails, even though snails are not a fundamental part of how the taxonomies describe forests.</dd><dt><a id="Element" aria-hidden="true"></a>Element</dt><dd><strong>1.</strong> A specialty of a <span class="setting term">taxonomy power</span> that is included in dice pools when creating a result or affecting a target described by the <span class="setting term">element</span>. <strong>2.</strong> A major component of a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span> that defines and creates the taxonomy&#8217;s worldview.

In the standard form of magic in The Tower Builders they will have at least a few <span class="setting term">elements</span> or a <span class="setting term">taxonomy</span> for such purposes.
Any character may have magic Powers or Power Sets, but they are not trained to use them in a flexible way like a spellcaster.</dd><dt><a id="MagicDice" aria-hidden="true"></a>Magic Dice</dt><dd>Any dice in a pool that come from a <span class="setting term">Magical Power Set</span> or a <span class="setting term">taxonomies</span> <span class="cortex term">power set</span>, and sometimes a magical <span class="cortex term">distinction</span> die.</dd><dt><a id="CastingDice" aria-hidden="true"></a>Casting Dice</dt><dd>Any dice in a pool that represent the mundane activities a character is undertaking to create a magical <span class="setting term">result</span>.
