That relationship is usually described in one of their Distinctions, and will either describe their magical training, a magical object that grants them powers, or a relationship with a spiritual being that grants them powers.
If the themes of the setting are a part of your GM&#8217;s scenario, characters should have a personality, temperament, or history that makes them part of a movement that is looking to make a better future for humanity via magic.
They should at least have goals that align with characters pursueing that Grand Dream.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_traits">Traits</h2><p>Characters have fairly standard <span class="cortex term">trait sets</span> for Cortex.
Those sets are: <span class="cortex term">Distinctions</span>, <span class="cortex term">Attributes</span>, and <span class="setting term">Training</span> (which are slightly modified <span class="cortex term">skills</span>).
They will also have one or more Power Sets, depending upon their relationship to magic.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_distinctions">Distinctions</h3><p>Characters will have 3 Distinctions, each with <em>Hinder</em>. Characters will usually have one Distinction describing their history, one describing their connection to or training in magic, and one describing their destiny, motivation, or future.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_attributes">Attributes</h3><p>The Standard Attributes are each a combination of a practical real-world sense or ability, and a metaphorical meaning.</p>
<div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt>Head</dt><dd>Reason and understanding. Competence at understanding complexity and learning.</dd><dt>Hands</dt><dd>Competence with projecting the body into the world, including labor, fighting, and crafting.</dd><dt>Heart</dt><dd>Strength of passion, confidence, and willpower. Compassion for others and the strength of your own passions.</dd><dt>Voice</dt><dd>Projection of yourself into the world, communication skills, charisma, and making your inner self heard.</dd><dt>Eyes</dt><dd>Perceptiveness, including willingness and skill at listening to others.</dd></dl></div>
<p>If necessary, you can think of the above in two groups: <span class="setting term">Head</span> and <span class="setting term">Heart</span> are internal attributes while <span class="setting term">Hands</span>, <span class="setting term">Voice</span>, and <span class="setting term">Eyes</span> are 'world-facing' attributes.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_the_training_set">The Training Set</h3><p>The Training Set is pretty much a copy of Skills from the Cortex Handbook with a few modified for the setting.
These Traits should always be subjects a character has experience with, even if that training is not formal schooling.
Training Traits are broad, but most characters will have experience with only a small range of the applications of each.
Interpret each Training through the history of the character to determine what parts of it they can use.
For simplicity&#8217;s sake, each Training includes any magical uses of its skills <em>if</em> the character has a reason to know magical applications.
For instance, Craft can be used to build costume jewelry and jewelry that can be made magical.
A wizard character will know Craft <em>primarily for the purposes of magic</em>, which does grant some mundane crafting skills, but they will always be more comfortable and knowledgeable when using crafting for magic.
Refer to the character&#8217;s Distinctions when there is a question.
For instance, if the above character&#8217;s distinctions indicate that they were first a mundane woodworker before studying magic, their knowledge of craft extends to mundane construction as well.
GMs may deny use of these skills when not appropriate for a character, or increase the difficulty of tests.</p>
<div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt>Craft</dt><dd>How to make things. This can include magical items.
Craft may also be included in pools when rituals or spells require making things as a part of the spell, even when the outcome is not a magical item.</dd><dt>Drive</dt><dd>Driving surface conveyances with which the character is familiar, magical or otherwise. Includes riding animals.</dd><dt>Fight</dt><dd>As in the Cortex Handbook, but include magical fighting and when using wands or other casting implements in melee.</dd><dt>Fix</dt><dd>Repairing items with which the character is familiar.</dd><dt>Fly</dt><dd>Piloting flying things the character is familiar with, magical or otherwise. Includes riding flying beasts.</dd><dt>Focus</dt><dd>Concentration and ignoring distractions, as well as meditation.

<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_magical_power_traits">Magical Power Traits</h2><p>Magical Powers are the most complicated part of character creation because there are many different ways to group them into <span class="cortex term">Power Sets</span>.
There are three different kinds of Magical Power Traits: <a href="#_magical_abilities">Magical Abilities</a>, <a href="#_taxonomies">Taxonomies</a>, and <a href="#Material Components">[Material Components]</a> but the last two play much the same role in magic, as described below.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_magical_abilities">Magical Abilities</h3><p>Magical Abilities are supernormal abilities granted to the character by some source of magic, whether that source is training, a magical item, gifts of a spiritual being or any source that makes sense within the setting.
Compared to Taxonomies, Abilities are limited.
They providing one specific ability on a defined kind of target: 'they do what they say on the tin,' as it were.
In terms of Cortex Prime, their power level is somewhere betweeen Powers and Abilities.
Their scale is smaller than Powers, but they can create Results similar to the SFX attached to Abilities without buying access from a list of SFX.
The Handbook provides lists of SFX characters may buy to go with <span class="cortex term">Abilities</span>.
For magical Abilities most of those should be available as test created assets or by spending PP.
See the main text for details on constructing Abilities.</p>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_examples">Examples:</h4><div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt><span class="ability">Divination</span></dt><dd>Form a question about a single object, item, character, place, or situation and select a taxonomy through which to receive the answer.
If you have an available taxonomy that applies to the answer, the GM should tell you to include it in your pool before rolling.
<span class="cortex term">Limit</span> - Deactivate this power and recieve a PP when you do not have access to your symbolic objects, appropriate entrails to read, or other requirements of your taxonomies.
The focus of the question must be present or <span class="setting term">targeted</span>.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Clairsentience</span></dt><dd>Shut down your senses locally to use them in a location you can <span class="setting term">target</span>.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Planar Shift</span></dt><dd>(Density Decrease) You shift your body partially into another plane. Describe the plane you shift into and the properties and limits that plane applies to you while shifted.
Create a temporary asset or spend a PP to shift into the dimensional plane completely.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Summon &lt;Element&gt;</span></dt><dd>Summon energy, matter, or an idea.
The energy or matter will behave normally in the setting, e.g. water will fall and heat will burn things and dissipate.
The effect die determines the amount summoned.
This power should not be limited to material things and could be purchased to summon emotions, ideas or imagined magical elements.
The GM should allow players to be creative, but should resist attempts to make "super elements" that accomplish what multiple powers would create without <span class="cortex term">Limits</span> that counterbalance the advantages.
<span class="ability example">Greek Fire</span> - Summon a fire that cannot be extinguished by water. Limit - Dangerous, 1&#8217;s and 2&#8217;s count as hitches for any dice pool including this power.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Teleportation</span></dt><dd>You can teleport without crossing the space between you and any location you can <span class="setting term">Target</span>.
Include this die when you can cast and moving quickly can help you succeed.
The GM may impose limits based on the size of this die or an effect die.</dd><dt><span class="ability">Create &lt;Servitor&gt;</span></dt><dd>You benefit from being able to create a helper.
Include this die when you can cast and a helper would assist in a test or contest.
Deactivate this power to grant its die to other characters or create an asset to retain it.</dd></dl></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_taxonomies">Taxonomies</h4><p>In Cortex terms, a Taxonomy Power is a Power Trait similar to the Sorcery Power from the Cortex Handbook.
This is slightly distinct from a <span class="setting term">Taxonomy</span>, which is a way of describing and interacting with the world, a world-view of sorts.
The Taxonomy Trait is the power the character&#8217;s study of the Taxonomy grants the character.
The Taxonomy Trait creates and manipulates "magical forces" as appropriate to the setting (see <a href="#How Magic Works">[How Magic Works]</a>).
Because of how magic works in the Tower Builders setting, Taxonomies determine what results and targets a character can create or affect with magic unless they are using a Magical Ability.
Taxonomies are much more flexible than magical abilities and can create a range of results on many kinds of targets because they manipulate occult nature consciously and directly.
Taxonomies can come from any major field of human study including: science, naturalism, philosophy, art, religion, literature, athletics, mythology and artisanship.
Even culinary arts is a valid foundation for a Taxonomy.
Each Taxonomy should be a subset of its field of study (sorry, you cannot have all of Nature as a Taxonomy)
and usually have between five and a dozen Elements.
See <a href="#the meaning of taxonomies">[the meaning of taxonomies]</a> for a discussion of building boundaries and limits into these broad descriptions of the world.
In short, descriptions of Taxonomies should include what the Taxonomy does <em>not</em> mean, as part of its definition.
Elements are the fundamental parts of how a Taxonomy describes the world, and serve to specify what interpretation of the Taxonomy name applies.</p>
<p>A few details, for clarity:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li>Characters may have studied more than one Taxonomy (therefore having more than one Taxonomy Power).</li><li>Characters may have Elements of their Taxonomies as <span class="cortex term">specialties</span> of their Taxonomy Power.</li><li>If a character is learning a new Taxonomy, thay may start by taking Element Powers first.<ul><li>While learning, those are the only elements of the taxonomy they can <span class="setting term">reference</span>.
When a character learns enough elements to graduate to understanding the taxonomy, the points spent on elements can be traded in for the taxomony, representing a more rounded understanding of the taxonomy.
Further study can bring the Element specialties back as they deepen their knowledge of subsets of the Taxonomies.</li></ul></li></ul></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_material_components">Material components</h4><p>In the fiction, material components will be included in many works of magic, as another source of the occult nature needed for a particular result.
The way a particular spellcaster uses Material Components is represented in several different ways as Traits on the character sheet.
Use of material components is quite common, but many schools of magic will spend most of their time developing strong and powerful Taxonomies.
To reflect this, wizards that emphasize Taxonomies may carry small bags of Material Components to create Results or affect Targets that their Taxonomies reference poorly.
These characters should purchase <span class="cortex term">signature assets</span> or <span class="cortex term">resources</span> to represent this, and those dice should usually be no more than a d6.
Note these on character sheets as a 'Bag of Feathers', 'Bag of Forest Items' or other 'Bag of &lt;component type&gt;'.</p>
<p>Some wizards will be so strongly committed to material components that they will port around large caches of materials for use in magic.
In that case, instead of (or in addition to, they can have both) Taxonomy Traits they will have Traits that represent collections of types of materials.
They may have a mule carrying baskets of 'Botanical Samples' or a 'Crystal Collection' in their pack and the practical effects of carrying around so much material are a great source of drama, comedy, and challenges for the character.
The problems caused by using objects for magic are a good source of <span class="setting term">Limits</span> on Material Components power sets.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-3"><h4 id="_magical_power_sets">Magical Power Sets</h4><p>Power Sets group Power traits together with Limits and SFX to create a theme for a Power.
Limits are specific times when the power does not work, or complications that apply under certain circumstances.
In the Tower Builders, characters may have one or several Power Sets depending upon the source and theme of their powers.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><strong>Remember that a character usually only gets one die per Power Set, so there is an advantage in multiple sets.</strong></p>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_non_improvisational_sets">Non-Improvisational Sets.</h5><p>Some power sets will only have magical abilities.
Characters that cannot improvise or modify magical abilities will <strong>only</strong> have magical abilities, but they still might have more than one power set.
Multiple power sets may add one ability each, when both abilities would significantly affect a test or contest.
This is a good choice for characters with little to no magical training that have been granted their powers by a magical item(s) or the patronage of a powerful magical being or wizard.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>After witnessing the traumatic destruction of their village, a warrior has a vision of an Angel of Vengeance, which promises to aid their quest for vengeance as long as they act with honor to the peaceful. They create two power sets:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><span class="setting power">Angelic Armor</span> representing the angel&#8217;s protection.<ul><li>Limit: <em>Angel&#8217;s Averted Gaze: Shut down Angelic Armor and gain a PP. Test to renew your honor and restore</em>.</li><li>&lt;A defensive ability&gt;</li><li>&lt;Another defensive ability&gt;</li><li>&lt;etc&gt;</li></ul></li><li><span class="setting power">Angel&#8217;s Fury</span><ul><li>Limit: <em>The Fury Knows No Limits (Uncontrollable): Both 1 and 2 on your dice counts as hitches when using an Angel&#8217;s Fury Ability</em>,</li><li>&lt;Swordlike ability 1&gt;</li><li>&lt;Swordlike ability 2&gt;</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>
<p>Characters trained in magic should also take Power Sets with only magical abilities, those represent the practiced spells from their training that are very reliable.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Celeste the Bright began their training at the age of ten and has mastered many spells in that practice.</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Practiced Spells</strong><ul><li>Limit: <em>Exhausted: Shut down Magical Training to gain a PP. Activate an Opportunity to reactivate.</em></li><li><em>Lighting Flash</em></li><li><em>Zephyr</em>:</li><li><em>Sun&#8217;s Rage</em></li><li><em>Teleport</em></li><li><em>Divination</em></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-4"><h5 id="_improvisational_sets">Improvisational Sets</h5><p>Some power sets will provide the improvisational abilities of trained magic by representing taxonomies or available material components.
Since Taxonomies and Material Components act directly through manipulation and creation of occult nature, they are far more flexible than abilities, but are more complicated and dangerous to use.
(They also are a little more costly at character creation and development.)
They also make other abilities more flexible, by providing the <em>Modify Ability</em> SFX.</p>
<p class="highlightbox"><span class="cortex term">SFX</span> - <em>Modify Ability</em>: Step down a Magical Ability to include it in pools when using an &lt;Improvisational Power Set&gt; power to create a result that matches the Ability&#8217;s purpose, but not its occult nature.</p>
<p>In other words: <em>Modify Ability</em> allows use of an ability as if it had a description that aligned with the character&#8217;s taxonomy.
That overall effect of the ability must remain the same, usually this will change the Element the ability creates or targets.</p>
<p>When creating Material Component Sets and Taxonomy Sets, reflect the differences in their use via their Limits.</p>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Aphor the Wanderer is never seen without his massive pack. Within it he carries his:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Crystal Library</strong><ul><li>Limit - <em>Fragile Collection: Gain a PP when you deactivate this power (for instance if a significant crystal is broken or if you cannot access your pack). Test to reactivate.</em></li><li><span class="cortex term">SFX</span> - <em>Modify Ability</em>: Step down a Magical Ability to include it in pools when using an &lt;Improvisational Power Set&gt; power to create a result that matches the Ability&#8217;s purpose, but not its occult nature.</li><li><em>Volcanic Glasses</em> - Volcanic glasses of various colors provide occult nature for the following Elements: <em>Sharpness</em>, <em>Fragility</em>, <em>Heat</em>, <em>Pressure</em>.</li><li><em>Regular Crystals</em> - Crystals with regular forms provide occult nature for the following Elements: Order, Stength, Clarity, Resonance, Spectrum.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>
<div class="example-block"><div class="example"><p>Celeste the Bright has also studied a few Taxonomies:</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul><li><strong>Taxonomic Study</strong><ul><li><em>Forest Animals</em>: Animals from the forests of the temperate regions. Elements include: Worm, Stag, Badger, Hawk, Boar, and Hare.</li><li><em>Myths of our Ancestors</em>: A pantheon of classical heroes and villians. Elements include: Naro (A betrayed cheiftan), Stantoro (a heartless wizard), Mijea the Stubborn (Naro&#8217;s daughter the hero that saved the village), Gheric from Above (The spirit that guided Mijea through the Forbidden Forest).</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></section></section></section></section></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-05-09 07:45:59 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
