These Traits should always be subjects a character has experience with, even if that training is not formal schooling.
Training Traits are broad, but most characters will have experience with only a small range of the applications of each.
Interpret each Training through the history of the character to determine what parts of it they can use.
For simplicity&#8217;s sake, each Training includes any magical uses of its skills <em>if</em> the character has a reason to know magical applications.
For instance, Craft can be used to build costume jewelry and jewelry that can be made magical.
A wizard character will know Craft <em>primarily for the purposes of magic</em>, which does grant some mundane crafting skills, but they will always be more comfortable and knowledgeable when using crafting for magic.
Refer to the character&#8217;s Distinctions when there is a question.
For instance, if the above character&#8217;s distinctions indicate that they were first a mundane woodworker before studying magic, their knowledge of craft extends to mundane construction as well.
GMs may deny use of these skills when not appropriate for a character, or increase the difficulty of tests.</p>
<div class="dlist horizontal"><dl class="horizontal"><dt>Craft</dt><dd>How to make things. This can include magical items.
Craft may also be included in pools when rituals or spells require making things as a part of the spell, even when the outcome is not a magical item.</dd><dt>Drive</dt><dd>Driving surface conveyances with which the character is familiar, magical or otherwise. Includes riding animals.</dd><dt>Fight</dt><dd>As in the Cortex Handbook, but include magical fighting and when using wands or other casting implements in melee.</dd><dt>Fix</dt><dd>Repairing items with which the character is familiar.</dd><dt>Fly</dt><dd>Piloting flying things the character is familiar with, magical or otherwise.

Specialization may be useful for characters that have studied topics not noted by their Distinctions.</dd><dt>Labor</dt><dd>Doing work.

Use when magic is helping complete a task convered by Labor.</dd><dt>Move</dt><dd>As in the Handbook, include when using magical abilities that help with movement or grant supernormal movement.</dd><dt>Notice</dt><dd>As in the Handbook. Use with mundane and magical senses, but note that Divination is not a magical sense. Divination uses Focus unless the test is about noticing details among other results granted by Divination.</dd><dt>Operate</dt><dd>There are few gadgets in the setting, but use this when they come up. This is also for using <em>complex</em> magical items where understanding the item&#8217;s use is important. Simple magical items will use a Training associated with the abilities the item grants.</dd><dt>Perform</dt><dd>Useful as in the handbook, or when magical spells require you to keep the attention of others, such as group Rituals.</dd><dt>Shoot</dt><dd>Shooting implies combat training with weapon or spells targeted as Bolts.

Survival is unlikely to help a spell, but Abilities that provide Magical Senses may help you find resources.
Note that Divination can guide your decisions when you have limited mundane sources of information, as one might when in unfamiliar terrain.</dd><dt>Throw</dt><dd>Throwing things, including magic items that create Results when thrown.</dd><dt>Treat</dt><dd>Treating injury and counseling, many magical abilities may help with this task and knowledge of the body implied by this Training may help with magical Results.</dd><dt>Trick</dt><dd>Deceit, including spells that create illusion.</dd></dl></div></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-04-28 13:20:39 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
