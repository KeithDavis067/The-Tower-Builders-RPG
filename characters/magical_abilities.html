Although creative uses are endless, they can only accomplish what their description allows and no more unless modified by an SFX or improvisational power set.
When creating abilities, refer to the examples to get a sense of their scope, but the following guidelines can help.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_scope_of_magical_abilities">Scope of Magical Abilities</h2><p>Magical Abilities should always have a specified <em>kind</em> or <em>type</em> of effect or target.
This, of course, is tricky because the size of a category is subjective.
Consider writing an ability to summon insects.
Is all insects an acceptable category size or should you limit it to <span class="setting power">Summon Ants</span>, or <span class="setting power">Summon Bees</span>?
Certainly it&#8217;s not important to consider exactly which <em>species</em> of ant you will summon?
The key is to remember that categories determine when the ability will be useful and when it won&#8217;t.
For example, <span class="setting power">Summon Ants</span>, can bring large numbers of ants to swarm a character or efficiently clean an animal carcass, but they couldn&#8217;t carry a message swiftly or impress a queen (depending upon the queen of course.)
<span class="setting power">Summon Fireflies</span> would be more impressive to most queens because of the spectacle, while <span class="setting power">Summon Fire Ants</span> would be mostly effective for causing Stress to the Hands attribute, (or the Heart attribute!)
It is to remember a broader category does not always imply an ability has broader utility.
<span class="setting power">Summon Insects</span> summons all insects equally, but does not imply that you can choose what kind of insect you can summon.
<span class="setting power">Summon Insects</span> is a blunt instrument compared to <span class="setting power">Summon Ants</span>, and will be most effective when the kind of insect you summon is not important for the goal, while <span class="setting power">Summon Ants</span> is more direct.
In the spirit of 'No, but', GMs should allow reasonable wiggle room around magical ability&#8217;s scopes by increasing the difficulty when the use is a specific sub use of the ability.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_ability_characteristics">Ability Characteristics</h2><p>A magical ability consists of a name, description (sometimes including an <span class="setting term">element tag</span>), <span class="cortex term">effect tag</span>, and sometimes a <span class="cortex term">Limit</span>.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_name">Name</h2><p>An evocative name can tell players a lot about an ability.
This is usually best done within the fiction, but if abilities are unique to a character they may not really have an in-character name.
Abilities with interesting names expand the fiction of the setting and indicate the trait&#8217;s relationship to the setting.
For instance, a simple descriptive name might mean the character named the ability themselves.
The character might be mostly self-taught, so their abilities' names have no intended use outside their own thoughts.
Alternately it might indicate they come from a magical school that values humility, avoiding grandiose names or crediting of discoveries.
Classically, many spells have names that refer to an inventor, such as "Alphor&#8217;s Sapphire Sheild."
Names like this mark an ability as so useful and its invention so important that people remember who invented it.
Or perhaps it is taught by a school with an academic style, where credit and tradition are important.
Names of any kind suggests that talking about powers is an important part of training, or that group work is common and members of a school need to communicate about abilities.
In fact, an in-character name can help players discuss options when making plans, and referring to each other&#8217;s abilities with familiarity can demonstrate character relationships.
Generally though, it&#8217;s best to give abilities descriptive names, if only because many players struggle to remember grandiose character driven names, or what the heck "Jonesy&#8217;s Magnificent Abjuration" even does.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_effect_tags">Effect Tags</h2><p>The cortex handbook&#8217;s abilities must have one of five possible effect tags: Attack, Sensory, Movement, Control, Defense, and Enhancement. Each of these describe the way the die is <em>expected</em> to help the player.
Magical Abilities should also use these effect tags to help GMs and players communicate about what an ability is primarily <em>for</em>.
Some noted about each effect tag follow:</p>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_attack">Attack</h3><p>Wizards are clever folk, and have searched this world and beyond to find and invent wild forms of matter, energy, and magic.
It is inevitable that they will take these magnificent energies and fling them at each other for the purpose of harm.
To model this, Magical Abilities built for attack should describe how they do damage, and choose two forms of stress that the ability can cause, or one form of stress the ability can cause.
In any specific contest the ability can only cause one form of stress at atime, unless multiple Hitches can be activated at once.
For example, an ability doing damage with eletricity would likely cause Hands and Heart damage, to reflect the physical and stunning aspects of electricity.
But it would be reasonable to choose Hands and Eyes for a Lightning Bolt ability, in which the blinding aspect might be as important as the damage to the body.</p>
<p>For a more exotic example, consider an attack built from "Antorian&#8217;s Lament."
Imagine a wizard has studied the mythical (or even literal!) tale of Antorian the King in which his fealty to tradition caused the death of his daughter.
At the end of the tale, Antorian is cursed by the Fates to wander the underworld, forever seeking anonement to his daughter, but unable to find her.
A wizard could summon his eternal anguish and shame as a weapon causing stress to Voice as a lack of confidence, and to Eyes because of his refusal to see his daughter&#8217;s plight.
Players may even find the possible combinations inspiring, and may create interesting Elements to cause surprising combinatios of Stress.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_sensory">Sensory</h3><p>Sensory abilities should enhance existing senses or create new ones, allowing the character new ways of gathering information.
Like all sensory abilities they should require experience to interpret.
A smell is unknown unless you know what causes it, colors can be hard to describe without referencing objects or pigments, and sounds are like the sources you have heard until you have a common library to communicate with them.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_movement">Movement</h3></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_control">Control</h3></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_defense">Defense</h3></section>
<section class="doc-section level-2"><h3 id="_enhancement">Enhancement</h3></section></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_element_descriptor_tags">Element (Descriptor) Tags</h2><p>In the Cortex Handbook, descriptor tags are suggested to indicate what expression of an ability the character has selected.
There are many ways "Claws" can manifest (super-metal, coherent light, ordinary keratin), and the player should choose one when the ability is purchased.
These tags get everyone on the same page about what the fictional "Claws" are, and along with the name, help make a standard ability unique to the character.
Since the Elements Improvisational Abilities describe can affect when multiple magic dice in a pool are included, it is worth it to use a descriptor tag as an "Element Tag" to indicate what element the ability is using or affecting.
Alternately, a well written Description of the Magical Ability should include any Elements the ability is using or controlling.</p></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_description">Description</h2><p>The effects of magical abilities should be described.
Although the Tower Builders has a deep description of how magic functions, this implies an infinite variety of magical effects, and even multiple ways of solving similar problems.
A good description should tell the player:</p>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic"><li>What the ability does, described in fictional terms.</li><li>Any elements the ability uses.</li></ol></div></section>
<section class="doc-section level-1"><h2 id="_notes_on_abilities_from_the_handbook">Notes on Abilities from the handbook.</h2><p>In the following, we&#8217;ll make some specific notes on constructing magical abilities from the Abilities in the handbook.</p>
<p>The attack tag deserves special mention:
Since <a href="#Stress">[Stress]</a> is attached to the five attributes, it should be possible to create magical abilitys that create those types of damage.
For many abilities, to
[.setting term]{confusion}, [.setting term]{haze}, [.setting term]{sorrow}, [.setting term]{doubt}, and [.setting term]{weakness}.</p>
<div class="dlist"><dl><dt>Absorption</dt><dd>Absorption is an excellent start for creating abilities that can catch and transform energy.
Energy is a complicated term in a setting before Newtonian physics, but the default is to consider anything that would usually be considered energy: Heat, light, radiation, etc.
The Tower Builders setting also includes wild forms of energy that create psychological, emotional, or even hard to define, mysterious effects (see the sections on <a href="#Stress">[Stress]</a> and the notes on <a href="#Blast">[Blast]</a>.
Many of these, can also be considered energy.</dd><dt>Adaptation</dt><dd>Abilities built on adaptation may be common in a medival setting; equipment tends to be expensive, uncomfortable, and heavy without modern materials and industrial production.
Task created assets are an excellent use of adaptation based abilities, and with proper targeting can me used to protect others as well.</dd><dt>Astral Projection</dt><dd>Astral projection can create a lot of questions if the 'Astral' is not well defined.
The version listed in the Handbook is labeled with the 'Movement' effect tag, but in many magical world&#8217;s astral projection provides a host of abilities.
Access to the astral world might grant movement 'at the speed of thought' or the ability to 'see' emotions surrounding characters.
The astral plane may even reveal secrets, and the metaphorical is made literal in the astral realm.
Each of these should be purchased as different abilities, in fact "Astral Projection" may be better purchased as a power set itself with many abilities within it.
If a player just wants the ability to leave their body an move invisibly through the world, consider an SFX on an appropriate power set rather than a die with variable strengths and roll helpfullness.</dd></dl></div></section></div><footer><div id="footer-text"><br>Last updated 2023-05-20 13:19:10 -0400</div></footer></body></html>
